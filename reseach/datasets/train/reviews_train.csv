2022-03-01 15:11:03-07:00|Duolingo is s great if you have a short time to learn a new language. If you are studying I a language in school, Duolingo can help you get ahead. My mother used it because she travels a lot for work, so in order to communicate with the people from that certain area she had to learn at least a few different words in their language. This app is wonderful. I highly recommend.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0

2022-03-01 12:38:16-07:00|As a language app it’s good.  HOWEVER, IMBEDDED ARE ULTRA LEFT MESSAGES LIKE:  “POLICE NEED REFORM” and Transgender and non-binary translation exercises.  Too bad this could be good.  It is never great because it doesn’t do a good job on multiple meanings insisting on a single translation when multiple are correct.  The only way to get their attention is to write this kind of review.  Little to no acknowledgement of any feedback a user sends in.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|1.0
2022-03-01 12:37:55-07:00|Get rid of the hearts. I stopped using duo for a long time because you brought the hearts back. Thought I’d give it another try and I dislike them as much now as I did then. I have limited time to work on languages and when that’s cut even shorter because of a few misspelled words or a wrong conjugation, it’s very frustrating.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|3.0

2022-03-01 11:36:50-07:00|Duolingo has helped me SO much. It’s really fun, and can be challenging but it’s not boring at all! I’ve tried other language learning apps and this is by far the best! It definitely deserves five stars. I don’t plan on writing a whole paragraph but I think my rating describes my review well enough! This is a fantastic app. |Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0

2022-03-01 10:33:57-07:00|I downloaded the free trial plus. I was just charged for annual fee but my trial period still has couple of days and the app didn’t tell me i’ll be charged, no reminder either because my trial didnt end yet! I’m going to report this app to consumer rights authorities if i don’t hear back from doulingo.Total scam. Watch out everyone.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|1.0
2022-03-01 08:48:11-07:00|I love duo and it has really helped me start learning Spanish. The pictures and levels keep the app motivating for me to come back everyday, rather than giving up right away. The only issue I have is that some of my lessons have glitches in them where I cannot fully type the sentence or phrase in the word bar. This causes the app to tell me I have gotten the wrong answer. When this happens it tells me I am out of hearts and I cannot keep continuing with the lesson, which really interferes with me being able to learn unfortunately. Hopefully they can fix this error because the app would be a five star rating without simple glitches.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|3.0
2022-03-01 06:37:46-07:00|I actually learned a language from this app! Also it’s free and when you run outOf hearts you can refill them for free |Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0

2022-03-01 06:00:57-07:00|Other than squandering user learning time, what is the point of the increasing number of useless info screens between lessons? The amount of unnecessary animation is a also waste of time and a distraction, and also seems to increase with each update. In the same vain, if I cared about leagues I would go to that view. Stop wasting my time popping leagues up unbidden between lessons. I hate all the tricks to control when and how users practice. I have speaking lessons turned off, yet stories can no longer be completed without speaking lessons. PRIVACY WARNING: Users be sure and check out how you’re tracked.

2022-03-01 04:58:44-07:00|*Unless you upgrade you only have 5 mistakes. This is ridiculous as making mistakes is how we learn.*the lessons are too long: too many questions and too many long questions. * the characters are distracting, you can’t get rid of them, you can only stop them from moving. However, you have to log into make that happen.* the app doesn’t really teach anything, the sentences are just nonsense ones that aren’t important when learning a language. There really isn’t much about learning the basics and how to have basic conversations. This app does nothing to teach you anything useful, it’s just nonsense sentences. * the creators care more about the appearance of the app over the quality of the app. If they put effort into the quality of the app, it has the potential to be a decent app, but they don’t care.* the customer service is awful.I don’t recommend Duo, there are better apps to use instead.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|1.0

I’ve been hoping whatever is going on would be fixed, but it has yet to be done.I will update my rating when the issue/bug is fixed.

2022-02-28 19:26:54-07:00|This is so easy to use and I love the variety. You’re free to go through the lessons, move around the different categories of words, just listen, go through stories and answer questions. You can spend just a few minutes a day and still absorb a lot. I’m working on Spanish but there are a ton of languages. It’s a fun app!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0

2022-02-28 18:09:45-07:00|It’s a great app overall, it’s easy to comprehend and learn new languages. I will admit, however, that there are certain things that frustrate and discourage me. It’s mostly just placement of words, like “do you want to take the train or the subway?” It has to be in that exact order. Another thing is lives. I’m completely okay with the five lives, but I don’t think lives should be taken away if you are still learning the words (haven’t collected a crown for that lesson.) Just keep these things into account when you down Duolingo. Like I said, it’s not bad, just frustrating at times.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0
2022-02-28 17:59:14-07:00|Sorry Duo, but the app is a mess. I can’t load lessons anymore on my iPhone and the download lesson feature does not work really well either. It’d be cool if I could actually use the app and it’s features.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|3.0
2022-02-28 16:33:56-07:00|First off this is a great app but the paywalls and monthly fees just to learn even when you make more then five mistakes! It’s very annoying, so that’s why I gave it a 2/5 star rating.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|2.0

2022-02-28 15:25:53-07:00|The app is good!! it’s actually pretty helpful the only thing i don’t like is the fact it punishes you for mistakes and makes you wait 20 hours to get all your hearts back by waiting. you could practice to get hearts back but i assume there would be a limit to it, and not everyone can spend money for unlimited practice.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0
2022-02-28 15:23:07-07:00|It’s overall pretty amazing! Though I must say the hearts are super annoying. It slows me down and just makes me want to be done for the day.

2022-02-28 13:43:16-07:00|This is app is super good for someone who wants to learn a new language. I love it myself but my app on my iPad won’t work so I have to use my mom’s. It would stick on that intro screen and wouldn’t open. It’d just stay there for hrs and hrs. If u can change that or maybe give some advice to fix it that would be awesome  Also plz make it easier for us to change our profile pictures ON THE APP PLZ! I can’t go on websites so plz change that! Bye!~Sincerely, XxGalacticSkiesxX|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0

2022-02-28 11:23:46-07:00|I sincerely love this app for all of the resources that it offers in language learning, both in the app and through the website. My husband and I have been regular users for the past 3 years. We’ve tried other popular learning apps, subscription based and free, but kept coming back to Duolingo since it’s so fun and easy to use. Language learning is something that’s important to the both of us so paying for the monthly/yearly subscription doesn’t bother us. What has been annoying is recently is what I call the “pay to play” features. It started with the Lightning round feature, which was fun at first (testing your knowledge against time), but has become increasingly dependent on “timer boosts” which you have the “option” to buy. Now they have changed it so that you have to share your progress outside the app, to get lingots. They’ve also now been pushing for you to use lingots more often (to get extra XP during a hard course, to get the double XP boost after completing the weekly review, etc) and you can also buy more lingots. I understand that the creators need to make money in order to make these language learning features available and I understand that running an app takes up a lot of time and resources. I am also someone who believes that people should be compensated for putting in their time and effort into keeping the app running. However, These additional pay- features are starting to feel more like traditional corporate greed rather than being to better the app experience. One of my goals in life is to be able to speak 5 languages, Duolingo makes me feel like I can accomplish this. I still enjoy using the app but  it would really be a shame to see Duolingo fall into the usual trap of increasing profit margins at the expense of their users.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0

2022-02-28 10:53:56-07:00|I subscribe to Duolingo, to learn a language not to learn how to spell names, like Herr Bergman, what a disappointment this is!!! All the German is correct, but the name is spelled wrong. I think Duolingo would rather be a spelling app, than a language learning app. Just saying it again, if my German is correct and the spelling of a name is wrong, you reject it. Shame on you!,,I get the 15 minute early bird review and watch that fool dance around for at least 4 minutes if not longer.  I won’t renew duo plus again.

2022-02-25 17:03:44-07:00|When the x (multiplication) sign is used with the variable x, it is confusing and time consuming.

2022-02-22 16:52:25-07:00|great app. however, you have to pay for the more in depth explanation of your problem. i also wish that you could scan the problems that you write, that would be really useful! i’m a student and this is great for checking my work or explaining something when i don’t understand, but that does NOT MEAN that it is a replacement for your learning. actually DO your homework! or figure out why it’s solved a certain way. it’s really nice to get the pro if you do the free week. maybe even pay for afterwards! depends on the person. hope this helped.|Photomath|4.0

2022-01-18 03:36:15-07:00|I desperately wish the app would update with these features or allow me to buy an upgraded version. As a teacher it’s incredibly frustrating that I can’t upload videos or send announcements longer than two sentences. I can’t upload multiple photos at a time and cannot even message my entire class at one time. So if I need to get a message out to all my parents, I have to send it to a few at a time and it’s really frustrating.

I have to add the child’s name in the notes section to know with which student the parent contact is connected, and I can only see that in the “People” view. It would be nicer to have the students’ names listed and the parent contact associated with the student’s name. It would also be nice to see phone numbers once a contact is established. I have to go elsewhere to find contact numbers when I need or want to call a parent contact. Lastly, I think the text limit on announcements needs to be extended.

2022-03-02 08:05:15-07:00|I love playing this.  The parti dislike is after I play a Wordscapes session, we get commercials for other games to download.  That is fine but there is no way for me to opt out 95% of the time.  There is no X to close the app.  I have to shut now completely and wait.  Then go turn Wordscapes back on and play the next level.  It’s like I have no choice but to download every game they promote.  Frustrating!|Wordscapes|4.0

2022-03-01 16:17:31-07:00|I’ve been playing this as a casual user for a long time but it’s got so many spinning, twirling, sparkling stuff running all over the page, it’s hard to keep playing. Maybe if I paid for “no ads” it would fix that? But why would I pay for something that’s annoyingly buggy now? Never used the coins, so didn’t realize they weren’t free …WHAT? Free coins that aren’t free? New level of dishonesty there. I did tournaments until I realized they only respond to me. If I push to win, the winning score is really high, if I don’t bother the winning score is a couple hundred. Looks like they’re playing me. I was doing good on butterflies until … a whole new level opened. Felt like I was back at ground zero so I stopped playing those too. It’s a never ending pit of futility.

2022-03-01 07:58:46-07:00|With the exception of Greek most foreign language words are not included in the puzzles unless they have become part of English language. Occasionally though one will pop up. Today it was “viva”. I was stuck in a puzzle and “viva” came to mind, but I didn’t use it because it is a Spanish word. The only time I could remember hearing it used in the English language was Elvis Presley’s “Viva Las Vegas” or a brand of paper towels. After it was included in the puzzle I reviewed the embedded dictionary to see why it was included in the puzzle. “Viva” was not included in the dictionary.|Wordscapes|4.0

Then you have to depend on them and there weapons hammers, gloves, party blowers, disco wheels, on really hard levels with very little moves, until when you do win with all that you (bought) you don’t feel good, especially if you look at how much you spend.

Whoever made this dumb app is dumb, and the people who like the app are crazy. I’m 9 and I can’t find sis vs bro on it when there’s no bad stuff on there channel. They have a baby sister they can’t do bad stuff anyway. And back to the horror stories, 4-7 can easily find it and get scared.

On the many sets that I have done in Quizlet, I enter in the term and the definition and then when I save all of them, all of my terms are GONE and I have to start over. It is a waste of time for students enter this information in, then it NOT WORK. I even paid for premium!! For what? I waste too much time going back and correcting sets. It is so frustrating!! Why does this happen? The info is in there when I save, then it disappears after saving. If the app worked correctly, it would be a great resource for students. But if a student doesn’t have the time to waste, then don’t use this app.Update 2/15/22: I hate this app with my whole heart. I just entered a few terms in the a new study set. It saved fine but I went back to add more, I added about 25 more and it did it again! Left all the definitions but didn’t leave the terms. The terms show as “…” so now I have to waste MORE time going back and putting them in. The response I get from Quizlet is not helpful and of course they don’t want to hold accountability because they just want more money from students.

2021-09-30 08:49:58-07:00|I won all the little figures a new games since Fourth of July. But ever since then I can never play the game at all. Every time I want to play it, all I get a black screen for hours. I really loved playing this game too. Even when I updated the game it shows the same result. I would’ve rated it 5 stars but ever since then nope.|Dumb Ways to Die|1.0
2021-09-29 09:06:12-07:00|The only problem I have is the two dudes with the weight; the pink one and the blue one. Once the game gets faster I tap on the weights multiple times- the bar doesn’t go anywhere... I don’t know if I’m doing it wrong but if it’s not working and I’ve tried everything I could. Please please please fix this. But everything else is great! have a good day.|Dumb Ways to Die|4.0
2021-09-28 09:37:20-07:00|The game was great before! Then you added “Unlocks and Money!” I liked how it was before and I would be more than happy if you added an “Old Mode” to the game so we could play the more earlier versions before it was, well… ruined and poorly made. The new levels too! They are poorly made the shadows have white on it. The animations are good not gonna lie, but come on! The sun screen one has the wave being splashed onto a person and if you look at the bottom of the wave, there’s nothing just sand! The textures are bad too! The one where you weight lift has stuff above the weights.This game had so much potential but you had to ruin it all with poor management and ads. What if we were back in 2013! It’d be great! I want the old “Dumb Ways to Die” back! Unless you’re money hungry you won’t do that. Please for your sake and the games sake, you’ll make it like it was before.Sincerely,A Customer who loved this game|Dumb Ways to Die|1.0
2021-09-26 10:33:48-07:00|The way they made this game they basically said hey watch ads on a broken game to continue in a life that’s just going to end the same way, on some of the puzzles it wont even allow you to touch the screen to prevent from dying so you instantly lose a life which then they try and make you watch a video to make a quick cash grab for a old broken game get real and atleast fix it to make it fun to keep people interested so you can make more money|Dumb Ways to Die|1.0
2021-09-23 08:05:38-07:00|So the problem is the recent update of the game. One of those two games is the weightlifting one. It seems easy enough, but once the games gets to its faster pace, it is impossible to beat! I even tried to tap as fast as humanly possible as I could, but I failed again and again. Do I really have to be THAT fast to beat that mini game? Maybe you should make it a bit easier when the game goes faster. I’m giving the game 4/5 stars just cause of that mini game.|Dumb Ways to Die|4.0
2021-09-21 21:21:53-07:00|I used to love this game. BUT YOU HAVE TO ADD ADS? Not even after tea the game is finished, no. YOU PUT THEM IN DURING THE GAME. I lost all respect for you.|Dumb Ways to Die|1.0

2021-09-06 22:18:17-07:00|Is anyone else experiencing the spot the weightlifter minigame? The bar will stay red as you rapidly tap and won’t move at all, and you automatically lose a life, this happened twice in one game which caused me to lose all my progress, love the game, other people don’t like the ads but I certainly do not mind as for me that’s not in my case, there’s barely any ads.I like the game, just sad some of the mini games are glitched.|Dumb Ways to Die|3.0
2021-09-05 05:46:19-07:00|Why did you add so many ads and also on some of the minigames you cant even win, on the one where you have to grab the empty handle you cant no matter what you do you lose, also on the weight one if its too fast then you cant even touch it you always lose on that too.|Dumb Ways to Die|3.0
2021-08-31 07:19:05-07:00|Fun game, but sometimes the game won’t respond to my input, like the balloon one is horribly buggy and I’ve almost never been able to get all the strings to drag to the balloons, or the weightlifting spotter one won’t recognizing I’m tapping.|Dumb Ways to Die|4.0

I rlly like that there’s daily challenges as well!! Those are a lot of fun! Each level gets more challenging as you go on. Although, I do wish the game gave specific instructions for new levels bc I was struggling with the laundry machine for a while until I deep searched on YouTube for help on it. I found a bug on the app which is whenever the person moves up to another level, it glitches & goes back then goes forward repeatedly 3 times. Also, there are too many ads on here!!

2022-02-24 20:06:21-07:00|This app is great. I’ve been using it for years to take continuing education courses in design at UCLAs extension program. I love being able to take classes on the go as a professional. I can watch lectures during breaks at work, at the park, on the bus, in a cab, on a plane, or at midnight. That paired with text books in an e-reader platform like Kindle is a game changer for learning.However, I would encourage the developers to consider developing TV Apps for the modern student. As a design student, I like to sit on the couch with my laptop or iPad an work in my design apps while watching the lecture on a 64” TV which is awesome. As a professional, class time is my ‘relax’ time so sitting on a couch after finally stepping away from my home office desk at night is important. If I’m working on my laptop I can project on the screen as a second monitor but sometimes I don’t need my laptop and leave the heavy thing at work. If I mirror from my phone then every time I pause the lecture video to do something, the projection stop from my phone. It’s also far better to watch boring lectures from the TV than hunched over a desk too!Also, we please make an immersive reader that works within the app. At the end of the day my eyes are tired and dyslexia kicks in hard. The immersive reader when signed into a internet browser on canvas is great but I cannot see important design images from lecture. Yet again, I often project written lectures onto my TV with my iPhone so I can see images and use the immersive reader on my iPad through the internet platform of Canvas. It would be great if the immersive reader worked within the app and/or allowed images uploaded by the professor.Thank you and keep it up.|Canvas Student|4.0

2022-02-23 18:46:32-07:00|I’ve been using Canvas for about 6 months and I like it on my laptop but not on my phone. When I’m on my phone, it occasionally says I have a 0% in a class when the day before, I had an 87%. It also doesn’t give the proper letter grade. Like for instance, I have a 83% in my biology class but the letter grade is a D. It just doesn’t make sense. I only have that problem on my phone and I’m not the only person to have that problem. Multiple people I know all have noticed the same issues. I would give it a lower rating but I’ve only noticed the issue on my phone and not on my laptop. It’s definitely irritating and it was very shocking at first. If I hadn’t grown up with what letter grade each percent is, I would be very confused about why it’s not showing up properly.

2022-02-17 06:04:03-07:00|Our school uses this app for students. At first it was awesome! We could “applaud” good behavior and it allowed parental involvement. But as the year progressed and the app repeatedly updated its limited parents to JUST seeing what dojo points their child’s gotten without allowing any response from home at all unless you upgrade to the paid premium subscription, which is utter nonsense. I get developers wanting to make money but this app is a fundamental link between home and school. Why repeatedly fix and alter things that were fine to begin with?! I honestly am hoping the school catches wind of this and finds a more parental friendly application to use at this point. The changes have made the app less than user friendly and requiring a subscription service to do anything other than see how your child is doing during the day isn’t acceptable at all.|ClassDojo|3.0

Also, I have an unsent message I had scheduled in November that I “cannot delete” that was never sent. And with the most recent app update, the group messaging feature is gone.

2022-02-09 05:08:51-07:00|I would give zero stars if Apple allowed me to do so.  Let me start by saying I do not want to use this software in the first place. I don’t need to know the minutiae of my kids’ day at school. As an engaged parent, we talk at dinner every night about how their day was and what happened. Unfortunately for me, other parents apparently don’t mind getting minute by minute updates on their children. If this were not required by the school, I would not use the software at all. Where I get extremely frustrated is the constant nagging for me to buy a subscription to premium content when I don’t even want the free content. I find this app beyond obnoxious and would love for educators to focus on teaching rather than updating unnecessary software. Since I’m in the minority, my request is that the developer of ClassDojo offer the option to turn off the pestering requests to upgrade to something I never wanted in the first place. I will never upgrade this software and find the constant requests to upgrade make me dislike the software even more than I did before.|ClassDojo|1.0

2022-02-17 11:23:38-07:00|I lovED using OneNote when it was part of the OFFICE Home and Student desktop software, when almost no one even used it bc they didn’t know what it was. The feature that I liked the most is now gone... THE COLORED TABS ON THE TOP (I’m not yelling) . Now it is just like other apps like IOS Notes or Evernote. The tabs on the top and pages on the side made OneNote very unique and easy to navigate. It made it really work like a binder or real notebook with dividers. Now, from when they released the free app version all that was gone, and little by little they started to add what they call “new features” (excuse me, but LOL), when they are not new. They existed back then, from the beginning, when you could even choose what to show in the toolbar... You could customize the tool bar! :) I still have stored notes from OneNote2003, 2007, 2010, 2013... (You can read about all its versions in Wikipedia). Why instead of reinvent the old concept they don’t just add the real new features of this Internet Era? I’m just waiting for the day that they say “Try the new idea, the wow new concept that we just thought you will love: Tabs on the top with color for each one, named sections, with their own pages on the side, each one automatically sized and aligned to the left, and our very good workable search engine; plus automatically synchronized with the cloud version... And if you lose notes you can find them in the Deleted Notes Folder.... etc” That day... I hope comes soon. The new App creators only need to go to the archives to rescue those features that the old makers worked on and realized that their new inventions are not new.UPDATE 2/17/2022: I realized  few months after my above review, that the features that I mentioned that OneNote is missing or that have changed, especially the TABS ON TOP, still exist in the desktop version, aka “One Note 2010, 2013”, etc.  I feel bad for my comments to MS developers, whose I noticed today when reading other reviews, that anyway they don’t reply to reviewers. Otherwise they would had told me of my “mistake”.  I’m happy that at least still they have most of those features in the desktop version, that by the way I was able to put in my devices as an app, installing it as OneNote Desktop. Anyways, it would be awesome that they integrate them in the regular OneNote app, beginning by giving the user the option of putting the tabs and tab groups on top, OR in the side as a column by the pages column.|Microsoft OneNote|5.0

The sync send the notes to my outlook.com email account. This defeats the purpose of the mobile app. I would like to see my Samsung Notes on the OneNote app som I can see and modify my notes across platforms - Samsung phone, Apple iPad Pro, and Microsoft Desktop PC. What’s the purpose of the app if I can’t see the synced notes in the OneNote app vs seeing my synced noted on my outlook email online?

2022-02-14 18:27:51-07:00|Where to begin with this update? They were some issues before it came out that seem to have just gotten worse. Half the time when you open a page you have to switch out of it and come back before it will let you use any writing tools. Pictures load and render incredibly slowly. And worst of all, there is this persistent issue where any drawings or hand writing get shifted down a few millimeters every time you left your pencil. Doesn’t happen all the time, but it seems totally random when it does, and that’s honestly just as bad. Microsoft, you’ve gotta fix this. The app is borderline unusable right now and defeats the whole purpose of having Apple Pencil “support “.|Microsoft OneNote|1.0

You cannot turn off the fountain pen on an iPad, which makes your handwriting look really messy and pen sizes increase drastically between steps so you can’t get the most comfortable size and it really makes a difference to your writing experience.

2022-02-06 12:04:03-07:00|I’ve used OneNote to take notes in school for several years now, but this recent update has made the experience mildly infuriating. For starters, the button for undo is right next to the button to view all of your notebooks and they are both arrows pointing leftish, so I keep pushing the wrong one. It’s not ideal placement or design. Second, this recent update has made the app very glitchy. Strokes of my pencil will disappear frequently after I write them and to fix it, I have to restart the app. This issue comes up multiple times a day. The app often confuses my hand and the pen so the page will abruptly zoom in or out or move over several inches while I’m writing something. The insert space feature now inserts a massive blank space by default and I can’t control how wide the space is many times now. Overall, disappointing update. I’m definitely considering moving to a different note taking app. The only reason I am continuing to use OneNote at this point is that it’s very tedious or impossible to migrate notes from one note taking app to another. Please fix all the glitches!!Oh and also, trying to export to PDF is a nightmare unless your notes are exactly the right width. It will try and export by cutting the notes into a grid, so when you export and print your left with a useless pile of papers that are completely impractical. Please give the option to fit to page width when you export, it would save me sooo much trouble and distress|Microsoft OneNote|2.0

2022-02-04 15:15:34-07:00|This has been the answer to all my prayers on what a note taking app can be. They have the best approach to making note easily accessible wherever you are. There’s only two things I’d suggest to make this the best note taking app ever. The first is supporting multiple windows, I love doing homework with my notes right next to me. The second is to not be connected to the internet all the time. Google docs does a good job of saving every chance it gets but not slowing you down with lag when the connection slows down and freaking out if it’s not synced. Other than that best app by far and I’m using the free version. Definitely recommend.|Microsoft OneNote|5.0

2022-01-13 09:44:52-07:00|BEST APPFirst off I don’t usually write reviews but i had too for this app because it is AMAZING. In the majority of apps it tells you to pay to teach you step by step, but this app doesn’t. It is a life saver and shows you related videos, other problems that are similar, and other things in the web. Best. Math. App. Ever.|Socratic by Google|5.0
2022-01-12 06:48:50-07:00|Made me failed a exam|Socratic by Google|1.0
2022-01-10 14:39:20-07:00|So the app seems like a great app and I’m some situations it gets it right but most of the time it gives a more difficult response than it actually is, or reads the question incorrectly. For example, I “asked” about the question “ Round 5.987 to the nearest hundredth “ as a test, and it kept on telling me what it was rounded to the nearest tenth. Some of the questions the device gets wrong as well. If you want to have a more exact and complex answer, go for this app in some cases, but if you just need a simple answer, I wouldn’t recommend as much. Thanks!|Socratic by Google|2.0

It has so many fun mini games and it’s goofy at ever turn.However, there seems to be a number of bugs that have not been fixed which is why I’m only giving this game 3-stars.1. The marshmallow in the marshmallow roasting mini-game is not rendered, and there only is a fuzzy shape of the marshmallow.2. A bug from the yeti-grooming mini game appears in the ice-skating mini game at the end when won.3. Sometimes, the tasks done to get the ticket don’t always result in getting the ticket. For instance, when prompted to visit the merch store to redeem a ticket, it would not allow me to redeem it after visiting the merch store.4. There is no sound when one taps on a character they have unlocked.Other than these issues I really do love this game!

2021-07-13 13:57:25-07:00|Amazing app! Not too many adds either. Suggestions:- I could play this game with young kids but the problem is that there are only words. Could you add a setting to add pictures so that people who can’t read can play?- Could you make it so you can either swipe the screen or turn it? I am afraid my phone will get dropped if someone is turning it. Keep up the great work and thanks for this amazing game!|Charades!™|4.0
2021-07-04 06:26:26-07:00|Great game but my purchases never save. I have to keep spending 100 coins on the same catalogues that I have previously purchased a d I brought the 500 coins and remove adds but it never worked.|Charades!™|2.0
2021-06-16 16:44:40-07:00|I had a ton of fun playing this game in all different occasions. I initially discovered it when searching for Heads Up substitutions after seeing the price. I quickly downloaded Charades and had a MUCH better experience than I ever did from Heads Up!              Overall I would absolutely recommend this incredible, fun, and simple, game! It can be played in a variety of ways and places! Just as advertised, it’s lovely!|Charades!™|5.0

2021-05-10 07:02:05-07:00|I was really bummed that the original “heads up” game wasn’t free and I was skeptical that any other game could be free and function as flawlessly and as fun as the original game. However this game is perfect! Great for car trips and has mostly free genres that are really easy to explain to others. it’s a perfect mix for my family of adult, teen, and kids trivia all in one game, no special modes selected! I’m so happy that I don’t waste my money!|Charades!™|5.0
2021-05-09 17:40:03-07:00|This game is so fun. I love playing it with my friends and with guests. It's so fun! With this app you can play Charades! without having to make a bunch of cards. It's free and it's kid friendly I love playing this all the time. It's so fun whenever you get some thing that you don't really know how to act out! Like say you got a cloud, what are you supposed to do try and float or cry like it's  raining? It's just the best game ever! And I think you should get it to!!!!!!!!|Charades!™|4.0

2021-03-05 21:15:06-07:00|This app has ads after ever round of the game and some of the ads are graphic and offensive. I was playing this with my little sister when an ad for a game of naked women came up. I found this to be sexist and offensive in the current world. This app should not allow such ads to be played especially when children could be playing. Awful. Do better!|Charades!™|1.0
2021-02-28 18:19:42-07:00|Enjoyed playing with friends but I have big hands and my finger was accidentally touching the screening which would end the round and would put me back to the main menu.

2021-02-11 10:01:25-07:00|App is great- but last night after playing with friends I was unable to close the app/unable to use my phone in ANY capacity. I was literally trapped in the app and couldn’t even restart my phone manually. I tried everything from having my wife message me so I could try clicking her notification but nothing would register so I held done various buttons on my iPhone 11 until I heard the voice of a 911 operator. Apparently holding down the power and volume button for a long time calls 911. The ONLY way I could get out of this app was to turn my flashlight on and drain my phones battery over 2 hours. I’m afraid of using this app again because of this and I hope that you are able to fix this. For additional Info: even though I couldn’t tab out or close the app, the app itself continued to work. Very severe and strange bug but overall the app is solid.|Charades!™|3.0
2021-02-03 13:56:50-07:00|I guess it’s a good game, but when I would play with my family every time we would try to pass it won’t let me go to the next one for a while and it’s takes up the time. So please work on it, to make it a better game.|Charades!™|2.0
2021-01-30 20:21:26-07:00|Too many ads, too short of time per turn.  Most of the questions are also pretty basic.  There’s better options out there.|Charades!™|2.0
2021-01-18 09:49:36-07:00|the free games aren’t any fun and how boring they were made me hesitant to buy any of the other ones. the pop culture one is super outdated. my friends and i had no idea what a lot of it was. it was honestly pretty boring and we quit after 5 minutes. maybe if you were playing with kids, the kid one would be fun but other than that i wouldn’t recommend it.|Charades!™|2.0

2020-12-31 19:27:15-07:00|I would’ve gave this app a whole five stars if THEIR WAS NOO MORE COMMERCIALS AND ADS!!! When my family and I would play this we had so much fun until after every round their would be a long ad. It’s seriously mood killing when your having so much fun and then boom an ad pops up when you wanna keep having fun  I would appreciate it if their were no adds so people would continue having fun! |Charades!™|3.0
2020-12-28 13:48:15-07:00|I love that I can create my own game, however I can’t edit the cards and the title of the game.  It would be so much easier. I would not have to delete the whole card just to fix a typo or the title of the game. Until this feature allows more custom settings I will keep my rating to 4 stars.  fun game though! My family loves it. |Charades!™|4.0
2020-12-27 05:22:04-07:00|Thank you ever made this game it is really fun to play with friends and family and you can play with more the 10 people it is so fun but I also like to play the games that I made but the problem is that when I want to delete or rename one or two of the cards it says you select an card to delete and when I press one of the cards and try to delete it is says the same thing. Please try to fix that problem because it makes the game worse than every game I have played. But it is ok and fun just try to fix the problem plsThanks whoever made this game it is amazing and fun to play|Charades!™|4.0

I have been gives grades I love, and grades I hate, they have all given me strength to watch TV and call my friends and sleep,at it be so that I never care for doing my schoolwork, I care more about feeding my cats then I do using the bathroom, I have even only gone to the bathroom at school, to finish my area, that at witch I pray to my all Lordy cats, of names they are Alberto,Zari, And Cutie pie.I’m conclusion power school has distracted me and I have been praying to my cats for 24 hours now, I’m almost done with my prayers, so, I must be off to feed my all Lordy cats, now, good bye, they are summoning me to the land of cat heaven to feed them, and pet them.

2021-10-11 07:51:49-07:00|The extensive use of colors in the initial fit test made this app unusable for me. I am green/red colorblind which is very common. Even after using the color filters as suggested in their help article, the similar shades/tones they use when trying to match colors made it impossible to complete the second of three exercises in the initial assessment. You would think they could come up with a more friendly palette as so many other apps have.|Lumosity: Brain Training|2.0
2021-10-11 06:42:43-07:00|I like Lumosity. I usually play it in the mornings to get my brain working. I’m 58 years old and trying to keep brain young.However, there are two games that I think could use tweaking. Word snatchers game uses words that I think are not used much today so it’s very hard to try to come up with them just by the description. And I would appreciate if there were another way to play the math game where it drops  the equations and you have to solve them before they hit the bottom. Math is hard for me and I have a hard time trying to think up the answer fast enough. I do like it as I know it has improved my skills but would be nice to be able to slow it down and think it through.|Lumosity: Brain Training|4.0
2021-10-08 06:03:24-07:00|I pay for the premium subscription and love it. I really like watching my scores for each category improve over time. I just wish they would release new games every once in a while. I’m on a 560 day streak and have played all of the available games so many times that I’m starting to lose interest. The Feel the Beat game has been in “early access” for at least two years. My subscription will be up for renewal soon and I’m probably not going to renew it.|Lumosity: Brain Training|3.0

2021-09-16 08:13:29-07:00|I have had lumosity over 5 years and love it. There are so many games that test speed, flexibility, and problem solving just to name a few.

While I recommend  Lumosity to my clients to exercise their brain. UPDATE TO THE REVIEW I WROTE 7 YEARS AGOWhile Lumosity was fun, I now find it boring.  I enjoyed it so much that I went a paid for a lifetime subscription. I think it was something like $250. But ... it has been years since they've added any games to the app! I have played the same games over and over into oblivion. I expected to be continually challenged. I'm disappointed & no longer recommend it to clients.|Lumosity: Brain Training|5.0
2021-08-26 07:23:07-07:00|This program is light years above some of the brain games we have seen in the past.  I find it’s challenges are perfectly “where I’m at”.   It’s stimulating, as I want to play it much longer than necessary each day.  The games are easy to figure out for someone on the spectrum. Or I found them to be there’s a lot of different things they challenge you on that I believe will really help me to get my mind in shape so I can return to a PhD program soon.  My mind does feel “worked out” but not tired.     The yearly fee is around 40$ and from what I can see it’s well worth it.  I plan to purchase it. I’m about halfway through the free trial now. I would recommend it to anyone really.|Lumosity: Brain Training|5.0

2021-08-14 05:39:56-07:00|The underlying algorithms keep changing the outcomes based on your actions, without disclosure. That is disappointing and keeps you addicted to wanting to score better. So however well you perform you will get screwed at the highest levels, leaving you unfulfilled.  Your actions will always leave you unsatisfied and wanting to try more. The magic of keeping one hooked. To this reviewer, modulating outcomes midway  based on your actions is undesirable. Try out some of the games, let them run without inputs, and the scores are different every time, even though ones actions were a naught. Alternatively, take random fast actions, and you will score high.  Knowingly playing hidden games with on my brain makes me squirm, unless I knowingly submit to it.  My recommendation is a 60% value.|Lumosity: Brain Training|3.0
2021-08-12 17:14:08-07:00|Love the game, but I’ve noticed that once level 12 has been reached, you’re never awarded it. There is just continually a new message, “The next time you play, you may serve up to [your current score+2].”   The level starts at 52. I reached 52. Then I have to get 54. I got 54. Now the new goal is 56. I don’t mind you increasing the goal, but I reached the goal initially set to be rewarded with the 12th coffee cup, and I think it should have been awarded.|Lumosity: Brain Training|4.0

I have reported that for my city the data shows I have been playing for over600 straight days but they list someone with several hundred fewer days as the top in my area. They claim they don’t know how to fix their statistics so don’t believe any of their ratings. It has been over 6 months since they have introduced any new games.

Tried to log in, it would not recognize me and kept sending me to the loop of free trial again, which meant after the 2 weeks it will charge me for a new membership again. There is no direct contact to customer service. There is an email on their web site. emailed them, sent a copy of my apple receipt, they responded (thankfully) a day later to tell me they can't find my email. Tried to explain that I was a member before they had this log on nonsense. sent them a copy again .. no response and if they ""can't find my email"" no luck?!!! Terrible customer service - absent! Now I am stuck with a year's worth of membership which I can't use. I have had many apps over the years and every app has that option of ""restore purchase"" without any aggravation. Now I will have to file a complaint with apple and if that won't do it, I will certainly report them to the better business bureau. The 2 stars is for the only game I like for attention, but can certainly find similar ones in other apps. Don't buy a yearly membership.. Actually, if a business is that awful with customer service, stay away! Now I see reviews 2 years back same problem with others, one person had Apple refund only one month of the years subscription. That person had the same Lumosity agent respond the same way I experienced, James. No interest in resolving the issue whatsoever! So it is not a glitch, it's what they are accustomed to dealing with premium subscribers for ongoing ripoff! ""can't find my email"" really??? shame on them and apple needs to watch out for apps that conduct business that way."|Lumosity: Brain Training|2.0

At least the planets, and maybe a few more of the popular stars. Thanks!|SkyView® Lite|5.0

2021-08-14 00:39:50-07:00|The point of the app having a red setting is so you can look at your phone to find something or figure something out and then look back at the stars and still have your night vision left in tact but there are searches and other screens that pop up in white light which will absolutely kill your night vision, this is a really silly design flaw but easily fixable.

2021-12-03 18:19:17-07:00|I love this app as it pertains to the games, although I wish they would balance the games better in terms of problem solving vs. memory etc. However, the advertisements are absolutely brutal. They make you sit through so many ads if you don’t pay for the app. Both Lumosity and Brainwell are very reasonable as far as the ads go. It is VERY hard to make myself train with Peak because the ads really just beat me down.|Peak - Brain Training|3.0

2021-11-26 17:59:46-07:00|So, I’ve been paying for this service for years.  I put up with being harassed for reviews.  I put up with be constantly coerced to do what *they* wanted me to do. I was a Grand Master at some games.  A Legend for years at another.  I constantly scored at the 99th and 100th percentile.  I logged in today and was told that I was close to leveling up.  At the game that I’ve been a Legend at for years.   I threw the app away and relaunched.  Three times.  Same result.  I restarted the phone and relaunched the app.  Same result. Bye.  If you can’t do something as simple as keeping score, what else can’t you do?   I don’t want to know.  And I’m not paying you for the privilege.  From a business perspective, you’re morons.|Peak - Brain Training|1.0
2021-11-25 11:19:17-07:00|I took the plunge and signed up for the paid version and almost immediately it started forcing me to watch ads to get to the next game or, of course,Sign up for a full year and pay even more money. Good luck with that business model.|Peak - Brain Training|1.0

2021-11-20 18:00:37-07:00|I’ve had the paid version for several years now and it’s my go-to to kill time, but with as much as I use it, I definitely encounter flaws. Objectifind- I can tap on the correct object 2-3x before it registers, meanwhile, if tapping something much smaller than the rest, it registers my tap on the wrong object.  Just seems like it’s triggered to work against you. Word Fresh- why doesn’t it allow nouns? Word Hunt-1.  Why can’t I highlight a word starting from the last letter?  2.  Why does the tip tell you to swipe as fast as you can once you find a word but when you do, the highlight exceeds the word and won’t register the word until you back track your finger. 3.  Why aren’t there more than 20 categories?! There should be hundreds. This is a paid game afterall.  (Same complaint for Slider, there should be more than just 10 game boards.)Grow - there are some letter combos that even jeopardy geniuses wouldn’t be able to get 3 or 4 words from, let alone your average or above average person. Word path- sometimes when bringing a tile back to the pile, it freezes on the game board. You can then put it back again, but now it doesn’t register any valid words made and the game has to be restarted. Flight Path & Speed Spotter (and others)- not fair to score based on how many of something that’s supplied to score.  For example- flight path- if I end up with 5 letters and 3 of them are the same letter, and the other two are random letters like q,x,z what the heck am I supposed to do with that?  Crash it and wait for more letters to be released one at a time?  That wastes the timer, ultimately affecting the score. Same with the Speed Spotter I can only spot as many “bad guys” as the game provides. I’m often waiting with a full supply of balls and no bad guys. Then the game ends and my score suffers.  These examples are things that shouldn’t impact my brain score as I am at the mercy of the app. Connect ‘Em Up is just stupid.  Same with Decoder. Turtle Traffic- sometimes the only option is to jump over something and there’s NO WAY to avoid hitting something that is placed too close. It’s set up to ding you.  I have completed several surveys when prompted but not sure what good they do as they do not allow for any written feedback, so how do you know what needs to be changed?Would love if at the end of games it showed consistent summaries (All results, not just how many words OR longest word, etc.  Tell me all of it, each time. Would also love the option to ply against other players. Same game boards for each, see who does better.  Also would like to see a global score board.|Peak - Brain Training|3.0
2021-11-19 02:49:22-07:00|I paid the money for unlimited games and it is so worth it! Love that I can pick and choose games easily using the Games. I’d really love to be able to go back and review a game when I am having difficulty...is there a way to show an instant replay? Sometimes I simply don’t understand why I was marked wrong and would like to see it. (Example...spin cycle) Some of the games that are supposedly for memory are not, they really call for staring at the screen until it disappears and recreating what your retina shows you. This is not really memory. (Examples...Perilous Path, Memory Sweep, Bounce, Tracker). And finally, some games would benefit from some randomizing. In Connect Em Up it would be nice to play second sometimes. And in Flight Path, it would be nice to have the bonus color on the upper left hand sometimes, rather than always on the right.|Peak - Brain Training|4.0

2021-10-20 18:19:37-07:00|Peak is an amazing value. The app is polished and the overall experienced feels new and fresh. There are large variety of games but you have to progress to unlock them all. The games are interesting, and they test a variety of brain skills. compared to other brain training services, Peak offers more than just logic and math or time management. One game trains your perspective and you have to adjust a 3D camera. Another trains emotional intelligence by having you pick faces of people based on their expression. Another you have to select positive words that appear. There are many others.

2021-10-11 23:09:05-07:00|Many games I’ve been able to advance to next levels, such as Legend, based on metrics concerning the game itself and not how many consecutive days I’ve completed a workout. Other games, the only thing preventing me moving forward is doing a workout 14 days in a row. I’d rather you use a metric relative to the game, like the others. Seems like a marketing ploy otherwise, and I already paid ya $35. When I don’t renew, this will be the sole reason.|Peak - Brain Training|1.0
2021-10-09 13:02:29-07:00|I liked Peak very much at first. I started with several days per week, and then started playing everyday. Today was day 80. First, I find some of the directions unclear. In turtle traffic, why does most of the game not have a second card to tap? Have I misunderstood and I’m supposed to be tapping one single card? Several games seem to be like this. The game will be harder if the directions aren’t clear. I’m scoring under my age group. But I just tried Luminosity and I’m at the high end of my age group. Guess who I like better? I’ll be cancelling Peak as soon as I try a few other apps.|Peak - Brain Training|2.0
2021-10-08 14:24:34-07:00|Great games that are challenging, unique, fresh and seemingly always more being made. I like how it lets you know how you measure to others at the rank you are at, shows your progress yearly, monthly, weekly, daily and how you have measured during the game session if you replay, which creates a personal challenge to beat your previous scores, increasing the targeted brain/neuro skill. A major bonus is that there are some games developed by doctoral level researchers that help further develop data, that give you access to their published literature and research articles, to learn even more. This app has a free trial, and you will want to continue. Caveat is that it is pretty much unplayable once you have to watch horrible game ads every time you do something; the ones that last forever and you can’t exit out of, probably with some sort of king or person standing in the rain which a pointing arrow that nearly drives someone insane.|Peak - Brain Training|5.0

The wide variety of games is impressive at first, but most are minor variations of the same idea. There are four or five versions of the Stroop color word test, a handful of word games, and then some clones of other common mobile puzzle games like Flappy Bird and Picross. With many of the games, I couldn’t tell what was being tested or challenged - many are simply tedious or poorly laid out, so the challenge is dealing with the UI. There is no info in the app explaining exactly what is being tested with each game, and the only metric of personal growth is their “Peak IQ” score|Peak - Brain Training|1.0

2022-02-01 08:20:53-07:00|I tried the free week and enjoyed the activities themselves. What I did not like was the bonus for speedy answers and timers. For reading comprehension, having a speedy answer bonus seemed ridiculous for all except the speed reading activities. I saw no point in them and pretty much ignored them until I saw my difficulty not progress any further or barely. Surely there can be other ways to assess learning besides how fast you can mash buttons on a mobile device. So I will not pay for or recommend this app unless other methods for learning can be introduced.|Elevate - Brain Training|3.0

Great learning tool. One concern- the estimation math game does not always pick up what I chose as the answer - either the demarcations are too narrow or my fingers too fat - have to redo multiple times due to errors- also synthesis doesn’t work well - I drag up the answers and it won’t take and then scores an error - impossible|Elevate - Brain Training|5.0
2022-01-28 17:20:13-07:00|As the free trial ended. A decision to pay x amount of dollars for x amount of months is presented.I personally don’t think you get to know the application enough in one week. I was not willing to work this into my expenses, because I couldn’t see enough about, what I WOULD be getting, before hand. Seemed wishie washy on what you actually get. The exercises are fine. If you are exercising your brain to prepare for something important. Then this application might not be for you. MENSA testing is what I am exercising for. In short. I don’t trust this app because they are shady about what’s included when you pay. Sorry my grammar is $h!T|Elevate - Brain Training|3.0
2022-01-28 08:05:32-07:00|I love the new look to the landing page.

I am learning a lot about myself and I like competing against myself. At 75, I am still learning! I wish I could just play at my own speed (for relaxing recreation), but this game puts a premium on speed reading which is my weakness - m any times I know the answers but I run out of time.

Maintaining a streak is fun and essential to me; however, I noticed that the Elevate app’s Achilles’ heel is keeping a track record of their users who utilize their app via LTE or through multiple devices. There are many instances that I could have completed a 365 streak if only this app fixed such bug. This is my very first time to leave a review, so I request the developers to repair this issue.

2022-02-04 16:56:21-07:00|During the first few months, my kids played this consistently and were learning in the process. My kids then found that it was easier on some games to just keep trying different answers, with no intent of thinking it through, until the right one was selected. Then they found that they can play with the avatar…and now that’s all they want to do is dress the avatar. I wish there was a way to only allow them to follow the learning path without all the extracurricular content.

I’ve had to delete and reinstall so many times I’m about ready to keep it off my child’s iPad for good. We loved it at first but within Minutes of using the app it would freeze. For how much they charge monthly theirs no excuse for this constant crash. I am willing to pay for this but as it is it’s not even worth calling it a working product. I’ll try again next month and see if they’ve fixed the bugs in this app. Not worth a penny until it actually runs without freezing every minute.

2022-02-17 12:50:58-07:00|I was extremely disappointed with the identifier. The app has photos of plants already misidentified in the database. (I tried it out on several plants that I have previously verified…and happen to be a photographer). Your end-user who is asking for help to id a plant is not supposed to be your “expert”. We would actually be willing to pay $30 year if this app was as advertised. Also, it would be good if sub varieties were also offered…and if you did not have them on your database yet, it would be an idea if you asked the customer/end user what they thought or suspected what it was…but don’t list it as a definite answer I’d until you folks actually have an expert Verify the identification. You should not be confusing your customers with erroneous information. Very disappointed. I canceled via apple and via email. One positive is that you do have excellent articles on the app.|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|2.0

2022-02-13 14:01:05-07:00|As a landscape architect, I’ve been waiting for this app since my first plant id class 25 years ago. Has been really accurate so far. Love the additional information included once the tree/plant is identified.|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|5.0

2022-02-12 12:40:30-07:00|Your $29.99 price would be fair if a one-time charge but such subscriptions end up exorbitantly expensive for something not often used. I will NEVER buy subscriptions to ANY such things. They are a rip-off and should be illegal!|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|1.0
2022-02-12 09:46:58-07:00|It probably goes without saying that this app isn't 100% accurate identifying plants. That would be pretty awesome. However, when you do see a mistake you can send info about what happened. You can also inspect the pictures and vote if it's the right id or not.  It's an ai using a database that gets built by users. So the more people use it the better it will get. I've already seen improvements in the time I've used it. That said, if it's a rare or confusing plant to identify it might still need more data. One example in my area is mesquite trees. It id's them all as velvet mesquite. We actually have a bunch of kinds depending where you are. I'm so close to the Mexican border we get a lot of plants not considered in the books to be in the USA. Birds and animals too. Nothing is perfect but this app is good to very good and improving every day. As far as common plants it has no trouble usually.|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|4.0

2022-02-12 07:43:17-07:00|The ID function is probably correct for me about 60% of the time, at least to the Genus level. However, it is pretty easy to recognize if the ID given is incorrect even if you don’t know what a plant is to begin with - but once the ID pops up thats all you get. I’ve had other plant apps that give you a selection of the most likely plants, which is a much better model so you can narrow down your search more, as likely one of the potential IDs is correct to some taxon even if not species. As far as I can tell, I can  change the ID of one of my results, but I can’t dispute it, which doesn’t make sense because I would not be posting the plant if I knew what it was and could correct the ID.|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|3.0

2022-02-10 17:37:47-07:00|I am continually amazed by this app’s accuracy in identifying plants and the quality of the information it provides about them. Recently I noticed the leaves on my potted gardenia were getting yellow, so I scanned them. The app notified me that the plant has spider mites and prescribed both natural and chemical treatments. The premium subscription is pricey, but if it saves plants I would otherwise have to replace, it’s cost is easily justified. Well done!|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|5.0

2022-02-28 07:34:09-07:00|I have been using stash for about 2 years now, the best part about it is the early pay and stock back rewards in my opinion. These days there are many “get paid early” apps and banks but, that is not Stash’s only benefit. You can also do investing through them as well, if you are beginner stashes simple buy/sell and weekly repeat investing style is rather good for you. If you are more advanced (options, stop loss, limit orders) then stash might not be for you. You do have the ability to have a brokerage and retirement accounts, they also have a smart portfolio in which they invest for you. Downsides is how long it takes for the sales to happen and you don’t really get to fully control the balancing with sector rotation in the markets. I sort of look at the smart portfolio as a better interest rate savings account of sorts. Stash doesn’t charge any overdraft fees or returned item fees either, they just decline the purchase and be done with it.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|5.0

2022-02-28 06:33:21-07:00|I was trying stash out so I invested only 5$ into stock and kept an extra 10 in the bank granite it wasn’t much then my account locked on me I sent in my verification and told me to keep an eye out for the next two days and then two weeks went by with my account still locked but I went in to cancel my account with the request of getting the extra cash I left in there but in TWO DAYS they closed my account without giving me my money back… so if y’all closed it in two days and had my verification why couldn’t y’all fix it during those two weeks!! Stash is the WORST COMPANY TO INVEST AND BANK WITH!!! if I were you I’d go with ACORNS I’ve been with them since 2018 and they have not failed me !!!

2022-02-26 17:29:10-07:00|I happened one day to see a billboard in northern Indiana while working some years back. I opened an account while driving and before I knew it, the account was pretty big. It was almost too easy to build. Very hands on in investment strategies, they have custodial accounts as well. It’s so for the novice investor learning their way.

I’m learning about investing and managing my money better due to the helpful tips and articles that Stash provides. I highly recommend getting Stash!|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|5.0
2022-02-26 15:42:32-07:00|This online based brokerage/savings hybrid has its perks. By using the STASH debit card, consumers can earn fractional shares of a stock (limited list to chose from) as “cash back” with each purchase. It offers early direct deposit, making funds available 1-2 days earlier. And there’s a feature to “Lock” the card when not in use. But this Green Dot financial product has its downsides. There’s a monthly fee for service that can’t be waived. Some retailers recognize it as a prepaid gift card and the transaction will get declined. It is a Green Dot Visa debit card so it comes with notoriously horrific customers service. It’s scary that there is zero fraud protection and it’s impossible to reach a human being. I’ve had numerous recurring charges, in small amounts, by unknown merchants, and STASH offers zero fraud protection. I have never gotten my money back from STASH and there is no built-in fraud resolution system. Additionally, if you file a fraud complaint, take out the cash you need first. STASH will deactivate your card the moment you file a fraud complaint. You will not be able to access your account until your new card is activated 2 weeks later. Additionally, this is a terrible way to purchase shares of stock. Buy/Sell Quotes and Transactions don’t execute in real time during market hours but rather random “STASH trading cycles”. There’s no way to choose to buy/sell as a Market or Limit order. And if you sell holdings, it takes between 3 to 8 business days (possibly up to 90 days) before it can be withdrawn as cash. The customer service is terrible. There’s no fraud protection. And it cannot be used like a traditional checking account or a brokerage account. It’s best for individuals whom want to use their debit cards to earn pennies and are perfectly fine with risking losing the rest of the money in their accounts.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|3.0

2022-01-23 10:31:46-07:00|When I select a specific show, the app plays every episode and keeps going forever if I get distracted. This app needs an option to turn off auto play (like every other major video app has.) Video addiction is real PBS, please help us break the cycle.  The Apple TV version of the app will no longer stay in the “live” tv setting. After a few minutes it drops back to whatever show is currently being highlighted. Please fix. |PBS KIDS Video|2.0

But it would be better if you added a comment selection and an option to make your own playlist. Plus I watched Thomas and Friends: All Engines Go and can you put it on PBS Kids?

However, we just bought a new TV that runs LG webOS platform, which is apparently not supported by PBS Kids app. PLEASE address this! I don’t want to stream through YouTube or cast through my phone and I shouldn’t have to use a Roku for this single app while everything else (Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, etc.) is available natively on webOS.

2022-01-20 04:02:00-07:00|This is probably one of the best word puzzle games out there, but I have to give it only two stars because of my frustration with it. First, it seems as if I spend more time watching ads than I do actually playing. And second, even more frustrating is how many times the ad freezes and I don’t get the double reward or the ad quits in the middle or even at the end and goes back to the original screen.

Yet…in every language I know the word for horse before I know how to ask if I can pay now or ask what does this cost.|Rosetta Stone: Learn Languages|4.0

2022-01-31 15:10:49-07:00|I’ve always loved Rosetta Stone and just started Italian today. A problem I’m having with Italian (being a gender-based language) is that some of their pictures are ambiguous with gender so I pick the wrong one! I get it, girls having long hair is a stereotype, etc, but it makes it difficult to pick the right gender when they both have a fade and neutral clothes on. That is my only complaint. It’s making me have to do the lesson over to get 100%, so I have to do it enough times to “memorize” which one is the girl. Other than that I love it so far.|Rosetta Stone: Learn Languages|4.0

2022-01-28 15:33:37-07:00|This is a good language learning application. But the voice recognition is very flaky and has been for some time.

2022-01-27 11:54:29-07:00|I know a little bit a Latin, so it’s easier for me to cover the basics of other languages. My friend speaks Latin-American Spanish. She is having difficulties with her English. I thought I would learn Spanish to help her with her English. I have tried multiple language-learning platforms, and this is the best one yet! It allows me to mess up without feeling bad but also gives me plenty of room to grow. I would recommend the “travel” course. Once you learn the Spanish roots, you can learn full words. For example: in English, if a word is plural, you just add an “s”. However, in Spanish, you change the whole sentence. I would have never learned this if it weren’t for Rosetta Stone!!|Rosetta Stone: Learn Languages|5.0

2022-01-23 08:52:20-07:00|While the Rosetta Stone approach to teaching languages is unquestionably very good, the app itself is an exercise in frustration. I constantly receive messages about the lack of the internet (which is working fine, as evidenced by me sending this review), which brings the lessons to a grinding halt. I also often receive messages about poor quality of sound from my microphone, regardless if I use the built-in microphone (on the latest iPad Air) or AirPods.

This is my favorite part of the game. I put in time and effort to climb the leaderboard, get 1st place, and advance to the next higher level of the tournament. But I cannot get past the Silver 1 level, even though I get first place. This has happened multiple times!! Let me paint a picture for you. This is what happened last night. I’m on the Silver 1 level, I work hard, use my coins and rubies, build a huge lead. I check on it a few minutes before the tournament is over, and see that my huge lead remains. Then I go to bed. This morning, I check on it. The game congratulates me on getting first place. I receive my prizes. I’m feeling good. Finally, I’m moving on to Gold levels! I click the tournament button to begin, and I see that I’ve been demoted to Silver 3. Why? The game told me I won!!!!! I’m so angry. I’m angry because I like the game, because I want the game to work properly. I’m angry because of all the wasted hours! There is either a glitch in the game, or there are not enough people playing it to have Gold levels and beyond.

2022-02-06 14:51:35-07:00|"100% a data collector disguised as a trivia app and here’s how I know. Reason #1. Before you can even start 1 trivia you have to agree to the privacy policy. I tried everything to get around it without luck. Within 5 seconds the prompt shows up and essentially locks the app until you hit agree. If you click the Privacy Policy and skim through it, you can see it’s heavily worded about your personal data collected. It will be shared / sold to 3rd parties and they might even reach out to other data collectors to collect more information about you. Don’t believe me? Go read it for yourself. Reason #2. Now onto the actually trivia. Here’s some actual questions verbatim. “What color is Shrek” ”Which movie is the snowman ""Olaf"" from?” “If you wanted to purchase sneakers, what brand would you look at?” “Which brand would sell you a car?” “Which company slogan is ""Eat fresh""?” “Which brand would you choose if you were thirsty?” Reason #3. It looks like a regular Trivia app; however they are fishing to see what brands you are familiar with. They use your answers to start building your ad profile, and know how to better Target you with new brands. Why should you care? At the end of the day you should have the choice to say yes or no to being data collected and/or mined . With this app you aren’t given a choice to say “No I would not like my data to be collected and sold off to an ad company so they can target me with specific brands” Now if this isn’t a big deal for you and you want your data sold then 10/10 I recommend. If you care about privacy then Do not recommend -100/10 P.S. To the Devs. Next time you develop an app, maybe don’t hire a programmer from Wish.

But the whole gems thing to keep playing or get help has become annoying. The ads are too long and at times get stuck, especially the Royal King junk games. Lately I can only get free gems once and it gets stuck in between Get Free Gems and watch Another Video, never allowing me to watch another video. Today, I watched and the game never showed the Collect Gems bar. It forces me to Lose Streak and pay extra coins to keep going. Very frustrating. Also the idea that your streak count in actual numbers stops after 100 is disheartening. Who wouldn’t like to know how many they got right in a long running streak?

One day, I was doing a vacation role-play. Once I was done, I decided to bring back my Toca Family at home. I was gonna put the clothes out from the luggages, and then I was done putting them out. When I left my home, the clock thingy was slow and poof! It just got me out from your app. So, I decided to keep doing it 5 times. I decided to let it rest so I could do it the next day. Next day, I woke up. I went back to the app and tried it again. It won’t work for me. Please fix this glitch or technical difficulty. Keep up the good work!! |Toca Life World: Build stories|5.0

Though there are some things that could be added to make it even better. If you could bring like accessories or outfits from the character editor out into the game to have a lot more cute and cool outfits it would be great so you wouldn’t have to go back and forth into the character editor to make changes in outfits. Second, more hairstyles. I would LOVE more new hairstyles. The recent new hairstyles are really cute but imagine there being more? Literally amazing.

2021-08-28 11:23:13-07:00|This app is a scam. Firstly, you can only cash out a minimum of $5. That doesn’t sound too bad, but it’s ridiculous when you think about it. If you don’t make that $5 within a certain amount of time, you lose all your money. I used to play this game a couple of years ago and the most I ever had in my account was like $1. Not to mention that it used to be ever night, now it’s only once a week. This has so much opportunity to be a good game but they ruined it|HQ Trivia|1.0
2021-08-26 18:31:14-07:00|Now it’s only once a week. This is a problem because, at the same time they drastically reduces players’ chances of winning (to once a week), they also now require a minimum of $5 to cash out. This doesn’t sound too bad, except you don’t get your money WHEN you win it. They hold your money until some arbitrary date that’s regularly 4-5 months later. Still, you could just wait and let the money accrue in your account right? Nope! Another little stipulation they added is that your money is taken back after 90 days. So if they don’t release $5 or more before those 90 days are up, you lose that money. So, since they hold your money as long as they please, they really never have to pay out. So it looks like people are winning, but after months of waiting they lose their winnings because HQ has set up a set of rules that really only benefits them and sneakily allows them to not issue the payouts as promised. I’m a long time player, since Birds’ Nest Soup days. I liked the company and thought the majority of their decisions were ethically in the right. This new development though? It wreaks of shady scammer app. Boo HQ. You’ve really managed to flush that success down the toilet. Good thing you get to keep all your money now. |HQ Trivia|1.0

Please let me play this isn’t fair yet you’re wandering why you’re losing people for hmm , then you guys haven’t paid out money to anyone in months this isn’t right at all that’s not how you treat loyal players who’ve been playing for years!! You have a option to pay people right now cause you guys are very behind on paying people and not lose people or not pay people and lose everyone !! I’m so getting tired of being discriminated on a trivia app just cause people can’t handle the truth !! Word of advice stop taking people out of games for  no reason just because you don’t want to pay people to win the game !! It’s not right that’s not how you conduct business on a app!! #payyourloyalpeoplenow|HQ Trivia|1.0

2020-04-06 18:09:31-07:00|The game is okay. Not at all what I thought it was going to be- boring and disappointing compared to what i imagined. Plus it uses the same words repeatedly, which gets old real quick. There’s no option to buy a no-ads setting, which also gets quite annoying. It also tend to get glitchy after a bit of playtime. Some of the illustrations are funny, which kept my attention a bit more. And the curiosity about what was going to happen also kept me going.

2020-03-04 10:36:17-07:00|The game itself is enjoyable enough but they made a disappointing change. You used to be able to get coins by finding enough bonus words to fill the golden piggy bank. They still have that mechanic but now you have to pay $4.99 to get the coins. You also used to get coins whenever you solved a puzzle. Now the only way to get coins is by watching ads or by paying the aforementioned $4.99. If it wasn’t for this I would give the game a higher rating.|Words Story|2.0

2020-02-12 10:35:55-07:00|This is a super-simple word unscramble puzzle disguised as a word puzzle prison escape. If you want a challenging word find/unscramble game there are number of far, far better ones out there. This is a super simple version of those games with a totally unrelated, poorly rendered, highly ungrammatical prison escape story laid overtop of it. It also pushes hints on you whether you want them or not, so it’s not like you can even enjoy the elementary school level of the puzzles without letters shaking at you telling you which ones to pick.

2020-01-02 07:42:49-07:00|This game is fun. My only suggestion would be to give people clues when trying to figure out the words. There’s 3 slots with like 6 letters to choose from. The problem is you can create multiple words out of the given letters. Another issue is some of the words aren’t consistent with the guys situation. For example one word was FOX. Fox has nothing to do with him going away for murdering his wife lol. I’m glad I found this game because the ads looked very appealing but it needs some tweaking.|Words Story|3.0

2019-12-19 20:36:21-07:00|Obviously bought reviews and inflated the score. The game is like an anagram game for first graders.

2019-12-19 20:07:02-07:00|Game is entirely built around draining your wallet. Devs don’t even try to hide it. It’s a cash grab, and I recommend finding a different word game app for this and other reasons. The dictionary it uses will also not recognize proper nouns, unless it is an arbitrarily chosen proper noun for the level (such as a country name), as well as arbitrarily allowing certain standard English words because I guess they’re vulgar? But somehow proper medical vocabulary is vulgar, but not several other slang and hateful terms, some of which would generally be considered highly offensive and are without any other meanings. So in short, the dictionary is not only incomplete, it is completely arbitrary rather than using a standard boggle or scrabble word list.Shame on these devs and others like them that can’t make a game that is sold on its merits and has to resort to micro transaction currencies for revenue. Its no secret that this model only makes money because it targets a small percentage of players with addictions, so continuing to use this model in light of this well-known information is not just a cop-out, or bad for the game market, but actually evil.|Words Story|1.0

He’s currently listening to an audio book series, and he says that he really likes it. Just a few suggestions, 1. Could we be able to download audio books for online reading? 2. (I don’t know if we already can do this) Linking two devices to gain the same book reading progress.

2021-04-23 10:10:28-07:00|Despite my frustrations with the game, it is addictive and fun. It can be challenging, especially when you are overlooking a word you know but just don’t “see” as an option. Overall, I do enjoy the game. To understand my frustrations, read on.My gripe with the game is that the dictionary in use (Wordnik) seems to fluctuate in consistency or in application from session to session (game board to game board).- If you accept the plural form of a word, then the singular should be acceptable, too. This has been the case for plural words that are defined as “the plural form of” the singular version of the word.- Personally, I don’t consider a suffix to be a word, but the game does at times, then doesn’t at others - for the exact same word.- The word “née” (as in maiden-name) was a word on a few boards/games. But the word isn’t allowed as a bonus word on other boards. This isn’t the case for either basic words or abstruse words that are consistently bonus words and/or on the game board, too.- If archaic words or words exclusive to specific fields of study are to be allowed, then that should be consistent. Some slang words seem to be accepted, but then a word still in use, though rare of formal in use, is excluded. Yet it is in the dictionary that the game uses (checked against web search using multiple dictionaries, including Wordnik. So, why isn’t the word allowed?- Using the “add a word” option to comment on words that aren’t accepted but should be, doesn’t seem to actually do anything, unless these aren’t added for multiple updates in a row.The lack of consistency is frustrating, especially as one of the aspects of the game is to aim to achieve continuous word entries (accepted words).|Word Crossy - A Crossword game|3.0

One way in particular, was in reference to black peoples’ hair. Quoting from the description from Wordink “(Adjective) of hair: tightly curled or twisted; frizzy (occasionally specifically referenced to Blacks’ textured hair”This was a made up word by slave masters in which they used towards black peoples’ hair. The word is not pleasant and was/has always been used in a harmful way towards black people. I once enjoyed this game. I no longer do.

2022-02-11 21:15:51-07:00|Edit: I’m knocking another star off this review because it’s been roughly a year since my last review and there have been no improvements made to voice recognition on the app. I have zero issues with voice recognition on the desktop app, but the mobile app’s voice recognition is HORRIBLY inconsistent at best. Certain phrases work first time, other phrases I can repeat 40 times and never pass, the same phrases that I have no issues with on the desktop. And it’s the Spanish course. I have to imagine it’s one of the most popular, if not the most popular, non-English Babbel course, and most everything else about the app is great. I keep trying out the app again every couple months looking for improvements, but the voice recognition is so unbelievably frustrating that I don’t even want to use the app. I will continue to use Duolingo until voice is fixed. I’ve got a 700 day streak to maintain there anyway. I definitely regret paying for this as is. ———————————————————————————Original: I love so many aspects of this app. I like the way the content is presented. I like the design and flow of the courses. And I like having the choice to pick speech, listening, etc. for review. The one major drawback to this app that I am shocked I’m not seeing in other reviews is the poor speech recognition in some of the lesson conversations. This is honestly infuriating to me sometimes. Speech recognition seems to work perfectly early in a lesson where it just gives you a phrase to repeat back and I never have problems with those. Then when it gets later in a lesson where there’s a conversation and you play one of the roles, the speech recognition becomes abysmal. Some of the same sentences or phrases that I had zero problems with early in the lesson will not work even after fifty tries. And it’s not like they’re extremely difficult phrases. One that I could not get to work was “Hola, Carmen, cómo estás?” I literally never got this one to work, and everyone knows this super basic Spanish pronunciation, but most of the phrases during the conversation portion will not work for me. I even had a native speaker try it and it didn’t work. I noticed sometimes if I drop off the first couple words that it will occasionally work, but that’s #1 just wrong, and #2 a complete guessing game. Now, if I fire up my computer and open Babbel in a web browser, I have no issues at all. So it seems to be an issue with the app. I thought it could possibly be my iPhone 11 Pro, so I tried again after upgrading to an iPhone 12 Pro and the issue is the same. My iPad also seems to have the same issue. This one issue consistently causes me to lose motivation to keep using Babbel. I hope that this issue is addressed in future updates because I really enjoy the other aspects of Babbel, but for now, I’ll just have to rely on Duolingo.|Babbel - Language Learning|3.0

2022-02-08 12:16:48-07:00|My family and I enjoyed Babbel at first, but as we progressed, the lessons became far too long, and with no way to save your work and come back later, we’ve been stuck sometimes up to 40-45 minutes trying to finish a lesson so that we don’t lose our work and have to start over. My recommendations: 1. Break up longer lessons into more manageable chunks to avoid student burn-out. 2. Develop a way to save work mid-lesson so students don’t lose progress if they run out of time. I am cancelling all subscriptions for my family for these reasons. If these issues are fixed, I would consider returning.|Babbel - Language Learning|3.0

2021-03-24 01:17:25-07:00|I briefly wish to commend TED Talks for having become a magnificent global forum for the exchange of ideas and ideals indispensable to humanity at this and all future stages of its profess and maturation.  The largest forward leaps in civilization on this planet have always been directly correlated with public information, education, illumination and inspiration.   TED Talks present an entirely contemporary means of providing that service to all by enlightening and stimulating the public sentiment, awareness and conviction by presenting individuals with the necessary access to factual realities, expert opinions, and seasoned wisdom in succinct, digested and digestible presentations of key points on the leading and most critical issues of the times.   As the inceptors and fashioners of the breakthrough documents that created and permitted modern democracy to exist, to progress and to thrive realized and emphatically proclaimed, the progress and stability of humanity is dependent on and the product of an informed and enlightened public.   Herein do we discover the preeminent value and serviceability of TED Talks in contributing to the ongoing provision of all these essentials to human survival, advancement and happiness.|TED|5.0

It also seems like the developers scaled down the home page and made the podcast section the main attraction.And even though the search bar reels up only 1-3 results at a time (which is a lot these days, because putting in a single word - like “happiness,” for example - brings up zero) I mostly hate that the thumbnails for the videos won’t show up anymore.I used to receive recommendations for great Ted Talks almost every week - from Graham Hill’s ‘Less Stuff, More Happiness,’ to practically anything from or similar to talks by Andrew Solomon.I do love that the download option is still free - but since the quality of content is so low on the app, I’ll be deleting it after my last few downloads and sticking to YouTube for better Ted talks.|TED|2.0

They’ll click stop 15 seconds into a round even though they haven’t completed their board just in hopes of winning. It ruins the experience for me. I’d like to at least make an attempt to complete my board. It’s stupid to even play if you are going to do that. Revised- I added back a star because the developer pointed out Zen mode.

2022-02-26 18:09:32-07:00|So I saw a bunch of ads for it and I thought I’m gonna download it because I’m bored. I was going through the first few lessons and it was really great, The lesson was super easy to follow and I got through them with ease. I was teaching piano and I was super excited but when I got to the end, it said I had to pay. I just wanted to play piano I didn’t want to have to pay. I’m sure a lot of people agree with me and it’s kind of annoying. I just wanna have fun not pay money.|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|2.0
2022-02-26 17:50:16-07:00|Well one day I just download simple simply piano and I didn’t have a piano yet but I am going to take your lesson so I wanted to practice but then I wanted to do face screen and it literally just put me in Piano again every single time I tried again and again and again and again and again but nothing would you the press the thing so it’s always say sorry you cannot play it on you need to get the face and I was like I am on the face thing I don’t have a piano so then I didn’t know how to deal with so then I just rest we’re doing things with my mouth I was like dirt dirt dirt dirt and it didn’t work I said like why would I even have this app if it won’t work I tried to delete it and say maybe this might work better because I just had this too much so I just deleted it and made it like refresh and I pressed I do not have a piano and it I press the keyboard I don’t have a keyboard and I said no but it still said oh sorry it says you are I want to compressing the keyboard you can’t play this you have to get a big screen so what’s going on with it I am definitely deleting us so I think you need to make an adjustment for her to stop doing that because it always happens to me and also a glitch so yeah I really want you to fix this because I really want to traceable piano with the thing please and thank you if any of you can reply to me|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|1.0
2022-02-26 15:17:28-07:00|I started the app up very excited and optimistic, but when I started the FIRST THREE NOTES the app was unable to recognize the sound of my piano. It was working for middle C, but once I got to middle D, it went downhill. How ever many times I hit middle D, it would. Not. Work. And I was unable to do anything else. Would not recommend, I would also rather spend my money on real lessons.|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|1.0

2022-02-26 12:11:13-07:00|This app has the one year payment too high I wanted to learn how to play the piano so I got the app. After learning three notes it says I have to pay $150 every YEAR just to learn how to play! My mom can get me a private teacher for a quarter of that price! In the add they don’t say ANYTHING ABOUT THE PAYMENTS!!! So that’s why you should not get this app|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|1.0

2022-02-25 20:13:38-07:00|I like the app and how it showed me how to play at first, but I don’t like how you have to pay to listen to music and that stuff, I thought this was a free app but you have to pay just to learn a piano. I don’t like that and I’ll probably consider re-installing this app because of payment|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|2.0
2022-02-25 16:07:32-07:00|It’s a good app and very engaging, although i was very disappointed when I discovered to get any further in my playing other than playing 5 notes I’d have to pay.|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|3.0

2022-02-24 16:53:11-07:00|i've been seeing a lot of people say that this app is overpriced & you can just learn from youtube for free. however, i think it's super nice how they let you learn the basics without having to pay anything. in addition, i'm somebody who really struggles with staying focused. it's hard for me to learn when things aren't interactive. i also get paranoid easily. this app can't call you stupid like a teacher can and overall i like it a lot! i think they should include more coordination exercises though, cause i've been struggling with that|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|4.0

2021-06-30 12:35:46-07:00|So I like this app and it’s really fun but the old one was a a lot better.

That annoyed me since I don’t watch most of the new shows.Next they got rid of almost all the games and put them on noggin! Wh6 do I have to sign into another app just to play games that used to be on this one. They got rid of my favorite games. I hate the new update. I wish they left it how it was.|Nick Jr.|3.0

2021-02-09 06:25:46-07:00|I’ve had multiple streaming devices like Roku and amazon fire stick, and without fail the nick jr app won’t cycle past one episode in any of them.  It plays an episode of paw patrol, for example, and when it’s done all we see is spinning blue balls in the center of the screen.  No matter how long we leave it, the next episode won’t play. Even if we hit the back arrow and choose another episode of the same show, or another show, it won’t work. We have to close out of the app and then open it again to be able to watch the next single episode. It’s been like this for years.|Nick Jr.|1.0
2021-02-08 19:48:38-07:00|With everything that has happened the past year, most people I know don’t have a tv provider anymore.

2022-01-21 17:12:57-07:00|When I first started I was happy because I was learning a lot and it was at my level, but then when I tried to continue it said I had to buy premium. I get you have to make money but don’t call something free if you only get a little lesson out of it. This app would be so much more useful if you just made it free. You can even make people pay for certain songs they want to play. It just aggravates  me that all these guitar apps say they’re free when they really aren’t! You’d help a lot of beginners and it would be so helpful. I just don’t want to pay 30 bucks for something because I don’t have the money. So please consider making it free and making only some songs you have to pay for. At least give us all the lessons!|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|4.0

2022-01-19 16:04:54-07:00|This app may seem great, but it doesn’t work! At first I could barely tune it. Then I tried to play the notes and nothing was going through even though I played it a thousand times. My fingers are sore and I’ve given up.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|2.0
2022-01-16 10:31:59-07:00|Yousician recently created separate apps for each of the instruments. Which, in theory, could have been a good idea, development-wise. But the reality is that this was only done to funnel more people into purchasing a paid subscription. Free content that WAS comprehensive, fun, and engaging, are now behind a paywall. Reprehensible behavior from a company looking to make more money instead of making more musicians. Would give 0/5 stars if I could|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|1.0

2022-01-14 21:52:34-07:00|Overall it’s a good app. The major issue is the note recognition is quite poor on acoustic, so you have to strum incredibly hard and even then it misses recognizing some sounds. So you end up practicing the same lessons probably more than you should need to, which eats up time. There aren’t really any competing options so sticking with it for the time being.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|4.0
2022-01-14 17:07:54-07:00|so i am new to playing the guitar, and i been trying to find apps to help me be better at doing the guitar. and this an amazing fit for me. and i’ve been getting better! so that’s good! i hope you will make more apps. cuz y’all are really helpful for us!thanks!|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|5.0
2022-01-13 22:10:40-07:00|I liked the app at first… until it was basically impossible to cancel my subscription. Really my main issue with this is i want to play my guitar, but whenever i use this app i find myself getting extremely frustrated and almost not wanting to play anymore. Counter productivity at it’s finest!! I will play a chord or a note or whatever and it just doesn’t pick it up at all or it says i played it incorrectly. It’s very frustrating and i will be cancelling my subscription for good this time. PSA: my guitar is perfectly in tune and i am playing the correct note/chord when told.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|2.0
2022-01-13 20:29:59-07:00|I was using the tuner and it kept saying “tune up” so I kept tuning up and then strumming just for it to say it wasn’t tuned enough. It kept asking if I was playing the right chord and telling me to tune up until eventually the string broke.I think it’s a malfunction because the app had been glitching (closing out of the tuner, switching to ukulele, etc) while I was trying to tune my other chords but this time my chord snapped.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|3.0

2022-01-02 09:54:00-07:00|I highly recommend this app. My concern is that you guys should add a area only for worship/gospel songs. The whole should be able for settings where the apprentice can learn from worship songs. No doubt many new subscribers will opt for this app instead others.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|5.0

After playing with other strings I played my 5th string 0 fret and it said I played 6 string 2nd fret.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|2.0
2021-12-30 08:50:54-07:00|Look I appreciate the hard work put in to make this app but in my opinion the app is really bad. It’s good at first with plucking and stunning but then you can’t even learn without having to pay for everything. That is why I give it 2 stars.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|2.0
2021-12-29 16:22:55-07:00|This is a GREAT app for learning bass guitar. I absolutely love it. The instructors are great (I also took some guitar and piano in the app; a true plus is you can learn other instruments for the same price), and the opportunity to play with music tracks of various styles is awesome. With the bass, it’s particularly important to hear music behind you and to play along. I’ve literally had hours of enjoyment. For sheer joy of playing, I can’t recommend this app more. However, I did struggle to play outside the app. There’s no information about how bass players play along with or adapt chord charts; no info about scales or improvising with them (which is what bass players commonly do); no info or training at all on reading standard tab and applying it to a song. So while I LOVE playing with the app and the way it teaches instruments, I wish it would cover this other important info. I’d also love way more jazz tracks and less metal, in a perfect world. But you won’t regret the money you spend. I’ve never learned an instrument so fast in my life.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|4.0
2021-12-29 11:40:37-07:00|I prefer my guitar tuned to 432hz and although Guitar Tuna supports this, I cannot find a way for Yousician to support the different frequency.

2021-12-27 18:28:05-07:00|My overall experience using to learn guitar was not terrible but not the best either, they give one vid on how to do something then give a bunch of songs, while this is ok for chords, things like fretting and power chords are not getting enough attention and I feel like it rushes to teach you everything about guitar but not teach you how to do those things. Another thing is the premium, they only give you 20 mins free practice a day and anything beyond that cost extra I feel like I don’t spend enough time learning and ultimately just not fully understand what I just did. I have been using this for a few weeks and i realize I need to find another way to learn guitar. I’d give a 2.5 stars|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|2.0
2021-12-27 11:48:19-07:00|The recent upgrade lost all the data so I would have to start all over.  During times of the year, people are busy and don’t want to continue paying for a subscription so the free 10 minutes was nice to get in a little practice. But that is totally gone.  The yearly subscription is much too high and not worth it.  Most of the songs you want to play are free on YouTube so I would not recommend the app .  Even when I was using it to learn, it jumped too much in skill level between the sessions so you were stuck trying to master the same song for a long time.  Don’t waste your money on this app.   Goodbye Yousician.  Deleting the app and moving on.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|1.0

2021-12-17 13:46:05-07:00|I love this app. It is super fun. I have a few problems though. For one, some things you can't click because of the starlinks, and it is getting annoying. Second, once you reach your destination, the GPS doesn't stop. You have to kill the app to do it. And third, you can't move the objects when you AR them into your world. Thank you for this app though.|Night Sky|5.0

2021-12-16 18:44:08-07:00|Very neat but feels like you are looking at made up constellations and when it counts they charge membership to zoom in to even see some what far zoom objects . Use free features but don’t give them your money buy crypto or nfts with that money or stocks|Night Sky|1.0
2021-12-16 16:37:23-07:00|I already paid for this a while back and now the developer gets greedy and wants you to keep paying for it monthly or yearly. Not going to happen. Like I do with most of the apps that you purchase at one point and then the developer becomes greedy for more money, I no longer support them and take the loss. I must have lost hundreds of dollars so far as I stopped supporting developers who shammed their customers and asked for money for their product only to add yet another fee a while later. These developers should lose their accounts and be banned from selling apps. Highway robbery. They promise you all the features once you buy it then lock you out when they discover they can make even more money from you. Shady business practice. AVOID!|Night Sky|1.0

2021-12-14 17:05:03-07:00|Good luck finding the settings again after the initial setup. Was looking for something specific and couldn’t get back to settings to make sure the objects were selected.

2021-12-14 08:50:51-07:00|THIS APP IS EVERYTHING I’VE EVER WANTED IN SPACE APPS!!!! It has a tooooon of stars, and even has dwarf planets and moons! I found my favorite constellation (Draco) with this app! There are a few problems, however. One, some of the planets and moons aren’t shaped like they should be. My best friend told me to write a review on this app and make a request, so here it is: MAKE HAUMEA OVALY. Two, a lot of it costs money. I really want to see inside galaxies, clusters, zoom in more, see Earth, but it costs money! Whyyy does it have to cost money?! And $199.99?! That’s CRAZY. There’s also $29.99 and $4.99, but even that is a lot! Pleeeeease make it all free but maybe add ads so you can still get money for removing adds. Three, please make an option so you can see constellations and stuff in both hemispheres, but then you can switch it so you can just see Northern or Southern Hemispheres. That’s all! Thanks for making this amazing app that has beautiful details and is truly worthy of a five star review. As for you star gazers, always keep looking up!  SpiritstarEdit: hehe thank you for making Haumea ovaly!  And also I understand if you can’t make premium free, but can you just make it cheaper please? Thank you for your wonderful app, definitely the best stargazing app there is.|Night Sky|5.0

2021-12-06 21:32:33-07:00|Tonight I wanted to show my colleagues the interesting moon and nearby planet. After struggling once again to shut down the incessant, obnoxious full-screen upgrade apps, they lost interest in the app and the moment and so have I. It was embarrassing and wholly unnecessary. Many other apps have premium subscription offers but very few so torture those who just want to use the free portions, every now and then, by blocking all access to the app until they find a way to shut down multiple screens. Sadly, I am uninstalling this app.|Night Sky|2.0
2021-12-05 19:23:19-07:00|This app is AMAZING! One thing that struck out to me was that a few days ago, I accidentally stumbled into observatories that are in my area which made me go out and visit one of those places a few days later. Today, I went back to see where else I could go, to my surprise I wasn’t able to find those places anymore. Just “Tours For You” that have to pay to unlock. Now I’m all for supporting apps that are beneficial to me. It’s just scummy that you seem to have locked away one of those features that seem to have been free not that long ago.|Night Sky|3.0

2021-09-02 03:22:58-07:00|I loved the original game from way back in DS days.This version resembles it just enough to make you remember what you liked.  But you don’t get to do that game very often.Oh, and watch an ad!Make a meatloaf… stir it…watch an ad… then cook it.  Screw it up?  Use game coins or watch an ad.  Out of game coins? Watch an ad.Little pictures for other parts of the game — watch an ad.I want to do another recipe… oh, watch an ad.   How do you grow food, who knows… but maybe you should watch an ad.Next part of game watch an ad.  What did I do wrong?  Watch an ad.  A customer is here he wants me to watch an ad.What is happening next… I should watch an ad.Watch an ad.  Watch an ad.The screen is 85% prompts to try to get you to watch an ad, 10% new stuff, like growing a tree, and 5% what you wanted to play originally.

2021-08-15 14:55:57-07:00|This game has a lot of going on with the mini games, personalization, and farming aspect that it beats the game in the nintendo switch. There are bugs here and there. I wish U could completely buy this version instead of the bad cookstar game. Would prefer buying this version completely instead of buying the smaller recipes but as someone on here said before, the game recipes are cheap. Just wish I could buy a premium mode that way I don’t have to see the ads.|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|4.0
2021-08-12 23:21:51-07:00|I downloaded this for the nostalgia (as most have). First thing is the actual recipe making is WAYYY easier. I don’t know if it’s because I’m not 10 and my hand-eye coordination is better, but it’s pretty impossible to mess up a recipe. Easy win there. Also, they’ve added like 20 different “extensions”. You can cook (the original point of the game), fish, grow crops, manage a supermarket, etc. In my opinion, it’s too much. There’s too much going on and I’m still trying to find the relevance of all the extras. They don’t seem to help you progress in the game it’s just a way to pass time. The ads are also a little annoying. You technically only have to watch a few but the option is ALWAYS there. Anything and everything you do an ad is available to speed up the process, or get more coins. All in all if you’re looking for the old game you played on your DS this isn’t it. Still kinda fun for when you’re bored|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|3.0

2021-08-01 15:50:03-07:00|As a fan of cooking games, I LOVE playing this. I can never be too old.I respect the fact that there are “movies”, or cooking videos. I don’t really like how you have to pay five coins for a new video, though, and this game’s English is a tiny bit off, I really don’t mind that, though.The best part of this game is that it is actually possible to fail. Some cooking games that I’ve played before are easy, and you can’t really ‘fail’, not saying this game is hard, just like how it gives you some sort of “challenge”. The recipes are pretty good too.My only problems with this game is that my device is really laggy, and I sometimes sort of ‘disconnect’. And you have to pay real life money to unlock certain recipes. That’s it, and overall, I recommend this game if you are fine with pay to win games.|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|5.0
2021-07-28 12:47:01-07:00|Unknown July 27I love this game, but I  don’t really like it when you have to buy the recipes/ food. I  want  to say that I don’t have enough money to afford any of these  recipes. I really not that kind of people who’s rich.|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|5.0

2021-07-18 22:15:43-07:00|I have had this app on my phone since i was in NINTH GRADE (age 14). i’m 24- going on 25 now & this is one of the only games/apps i keep on my phone. It’s low stress/anxiety and very calming after a long, crazy day. The recipe packs are super cheap to the point i own every single one. There’s so many recipes to earn/buy that I still haven’t made every recipe, let alone master them all. Not sure what people are talking about when they mention ads? I get one maybe every 30 mins - sometimes i go longer without seeing one. The other ones you can watch to earn coins, which i earn through recipes, the restaurant, the farm, etc. There’s so much to do in one game. Not to mention the major nostalgia value. I don’t know - I guess I don’t understand why everyone’s so butthurt when i’ve been playing this game for at least 15 years and have nooo issue with this version. I feel like y’all are just mad you have to pay for the recipes now instead of earning all of them. It’s an app - like *most* apps, there’s a paywall for certain things. Quit whining. Side note for the game developers: i would absolutely LOVE some new recipe packs soon! I know they take time to roll out though, so i’ll be patient!|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|5.0

Don’t waste you’re coin on this just buy the game for console with no micro transactions and pop up ads. and NO there isn’t a crypto scam that hacks you’re switch it was made up cause the game was unlisted due to copyright issues.|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|1.0

2021-06-23 12:11:47-07:00|Hello! Thank you for looking at this review. Here is my opinion of the game. I think it’s a very fun game! I have always been into cooking and I personally think that this game could help with cooking. I’m 10 years old now, but I still like to cook. The app doesn’t have that many adds which is very relieving. Almost all the games I have have at least 2 adds per minute. But cooking mama has 2 adds per every 10 minutes basically. That makes me so happy and gives me more time to actually play and enjoy the game. I also really like all the dishes you can make. There is so many to choose from! My personal favorite is the sushi balls. Their really fun to make! I also like how’s it gives you some help, and is not hard. Another feature I like is that you have your own little restaurant and you can sell the food you make. I also like that when you finish making your dish, you always get rewarded with $20 or $10 (money from the game). There is just one problem. I actually prefer the old cooking mama then this big new update. The update isn’t much different from what it was a couple years ago but they made some weird changes. I thought you earn the dishes, but when I started playing for the first time after a couple years I had so many new dishes that I haven’t cooked yet. That part really bugged me. But other then that the game is fantastic! Definitely recommended.                                                    -XOXO|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|4.0
2021-06-21 06:08:20-07:00|So there is 24 hour melas and I took time and cooked it and then after there was a ad and then after the ad there was not a x to exit out of the ad so I closed cooking mama and opened it back up and the recipe was gone it did not save.

When I cook something, it get to the “ green” section, and then it go’s “ red” right as it go’s green. That is the only problem. Please fix this, if you can!

2021-05-23 06:15:38-07:00|Only thing that I can say about this game is that there is a lot of ads and at the end when you’re done cooking or making something during a dish she says “wow even better than mama” and after a while it can get annoying to hear over and over so I wish I was like a button where you can just keep going through without herring her say”wow even better than mama”all the time but overall this is a great game but I do miss the old one|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|4.0

2021-05-14 09:39:43-07:00|From playing Cooking Mama back on my mom’s iPhone 3 to my own iPhone 11, this childhood game has always given my relatives and I a good game to play on the Wii console. But this mobile game kinda lowered my hopes, the last time I got the game was when there wasn’t a restaurant and a farm (which got me me more excited to know about the additions). However, the game has a few bugs, I watched an ad to gain 2 of the foods the have a smiley face and it showed in the storage that I have one when in reality I had two before trying to gain two more. Then the game eventually froze on me. I wish for the best of the future developments!|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|3.0

It’s a fun cute game that reminds me when I was a kid with my ds but it’s hard to do half the tasks with newer iPhones. Side swipe will exit out the game repeatily if it has you doing certain tasks (putting trays in fridge, flipping stuff in pan, etc) it’s a cute but overwhelming game though. Just be aware of side swipe on newer iPhones and tasks!!!!|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|3.0

2021-04-17 21:05:02-07:00|I don't play this often but in the past I played it before and I like it. Now there are all these new things and everywhere I looked was all these new things and my screen, it was covered. I keep getting these things popping up every 3 seconds whenever I join and its overwhelming. Don't get me wrong it's still fun and stuff but its also a bit to easy. Whatever I do I keep getting 3 star. So my suggestions are maybe make it more challenging, a lot less stuff on the screen like random ads, daily rewards, happy foods--stuff like that, and maybe make it a bit easier to understand and what things are for. Now I can't say to much cause I haven't looked at everything but still.|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|3.0

2020-06-02 15:01:39-07:00|In the IPad version, I’m not allowed to give a score for the short answers in a quiz.iPad version I also cannot request resubmission of an assignment.I would like to see the table like in the desktop version, that shows all the assignments and scores. This way I can see at a quick glance which students don’t have the assignment scores or turned in - very handy when you’ve got 100+ students and multiple assignments.When grading assignments in the IPad version, I have to always type in the total score, very annoying when you have lots of students. This is different from the desktop version that once you type in the “out of” or maximum score, it’s there for the rest of the assignments. Also helpful if you’re interrupted and have to stop for a long time - I’ve actually forgotten what my total score should have been and typed in the wrong one!|Edmodo: Your Online Classroom|3.0

Especially if you’re logged into Edmodo on more than one device. I submit an assignment on Edmodo on my phone, then on my iPad, Edmodo will say it’s late or I still have to submit.

I have just read some of the responses from the app’s developers, who are part of Wikipedia.org. They are as dismissive, critical, snarky, and of a similar tone to comments by Wikipedia overseers. The contempt of the developers is particularly telling when they leave condescending responses to reviews that aren’t about the app but rather about Wikipedia itself. Yet are interestingly silent when it comes to reviews with valid criticisms of the app. (Perhaps there ought to be an article on self-help for the developers’ egos, or for one particular developer, is needed). Regardless whether the app developers are employees or volunteers, I’d think any time and effort of the “small team” would be more effectively spent on responding to valid app reviews, and on improving the app.Be a grown up and leave your easily offended ego someplace else I was going to say “at home.” Upon thinking about the implications of this, however, I realized leaving easily offended egos at home is NOT an acceptable place to leave them.

2022-01-29 11:41:00-07:00|I had 0 issues with Blackboard last year, it would remember my log in and was pretty quick to load (not always the best at loading at times). I don’t know what the developers did within the past two months but I I have to login every time. Sometimes it doesn’t sign me in after I entered my information. It’s just frustrating and I don’t like using the website but their app is not functioning properly. Also don’t like how they’re not fixing this issue…|Blackboard|1.0
2022-01-29 10:43:54-07:00|I’ve used blackboard since I was in first grade and even then it was so frustrating to use! I am now a college student and I thought I escaped using blackboard but unfortunately I have not. I hate how old and un modern the website/app is just looking at it makes me unmotivated to do any work. Even my teachers complain about how much they dislike using Blackboard. I hate how you can’t customize anything. The app is slow and sometimes just doesn’t load anything in. The activity stream never works, instead it should just show upcoming assignments, and you should have a push notification/email for when grades are released. The calendar is AWFUL, just show the whole calendar with all the work due listed for each day! Submitting work is so painful and could be a lot more simple. PLEASE BLACKBOARD just make it more user friendly!!! or take some ideas from Canvas!!|Blackboard|1.0
2022-01-29 10:01:05-07:00|Used to be good, now it constantly logs you out and tells you there’s an error on their end. If it’s on their end, why hasn’t it been fixed? Just dumb|Blackboard|1.0

2022-01-27 10:37:29-07:00|Blackboard is fine on an URL but as an app on an apple device, I cannot access half the things I can on the actual site.  This has made working remote kind of a nightmare as I started classes working remote unexpectedly :((|Blackboard|1.0

2022-01-26 07:27:17-07:00|Always crashing it’s good but not 4.5 stars I’m convinced the 4 star and above reviews are artificial because that is not the case Edit: I came back to give less stars, this app is terrible and hasn’t allowed me to login for days, I just wish my school would transition to canvas instead.|Blackboard|1.0
2022-01-25 11:00:00-07:00|"I usually delete any app with this many bugs, but I have to use it for grad school. Why it's buggy: Too often when I re-open it (because you can't stay logged in, as others have noted), it either freezes or gives me a false error message. Once open, it's slow to update; 5 minutes can pass before new grades or other additions show up. And Discussion threads often fail to load, or it won't load my posts after I submit them. All of this is troublesome because ""try again later"" is not an option when you're on deadline.Why it's balky:The app doesn't allow split screen, one of the iPad's most useful features. The ""Activity Stream"" is pointless yet remains the mandatory default open page, while too many clicks are required to get to a page one actually cares about (and repeatedly visits). When writing a reply in Discussions, it's impossible to see the original post one is replying to. Pasting text into Discussion posts (unless in plain text?) eliminates kind-of-important elements like apostrophes. There's no way to tailor notifications. There's no way to modify and correct ""overdue"" notifications for assignments that aren't necessary or were turned in late. What's needed:Less freezing and faster uploads. More tailoring options, including a ""Favorites"" list. More control over notifications. A neater Discussion interface."|Blackboard|2.0

It makes you log in every single time of usage and takes you to your university’s web login page. It then continues to give you the web page look of blackboard. If you exit the app at all then it makes you log in again and go through all the steps. At this point it’s easier to log into blackboard on safari than the app. Please update the app and resolve this issue, it used to work so well!|Blackboard|1.0

All you do it wake up a tired guy with a red ball. ADD MORE FEATURES TO IT! Seriously, it looks fun, but it’s not. 2. Too many ads. Ads are like my nemesis. They make me angry, and to me they seem pointless. Some were even inappropriate and disturbing for kids. If you want to add ads in, FINE. But actually make them appropriate for kids! Well, if you can do that. 3. THE AD OF THIS GAME WAS THE WHOLE REASON I GOT THE GAME! OH MY GOD! This app looks fun? BELIEVE ME! IT AIN’T FUN. It shows a guy doing hobbies or something, and there is a water balloon! When I first got this, I wondered: hmm! That looks fun! I tried it, and it WAS fun at first..but eventually it was boring.

2021-06-06 15:11:49-07:00|I’ll start out by saying I love this app. As a huge reader I found it really useful to have my entire school library on my phone. One thing is if I was waiting for a hold, I wouldn’t find out my hold was ready until I opened the app to read something else. I think it would be really useful to have notifications that would send out to alert you when a hold was ready or when it was almost time to take a book back. Other than that, it’s a perfect app for students like me who love reading on their phones. I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn’t like reading as much because their are audiobooks as well as ebooks. Anyway please look into the notifications thing and thank you for your time!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0

You can choose any books you want it’s awesome when you can bookmark and highlight words and phrases in the book and come back to it later. However, the holds are not good. I placed a hold for a book on January 3rd, 2021. I was the first person in line after the person who had the book right now. It’s now May 6th and I am still waiting for the book! There are 5 other people in line behind me but I think the person who was reading it is not on Sora anymore. But it won’t release the book to me.  Can that be changed?|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-04-30 13:52:49-07:00|This app is really great and I’ve been using it for a while now. However, I have been experiencing a bit of trouble recently. Everything was fine, and I had just gone into the app, when I realized that all the books I had borrowed were gone. I figured it might just be a glitch, so I went in and out again, but it still wasn’t working. So I tried to type the name of a book I wanted to read, and it started to load for a while, but then it said “could not load this list. Please try another”. I’ve tried all kinds of different books, and nothing works. I even deleted and reinstalled the app, but nothing is working. I was wondering if there was a way to fix this, or if I should just wait for a while. Please reply back soon if you can fix it. Thank you!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0
2021-04-27 19:35:44-07:00|I love being able to check books out and read them but lately when i get on the app and open the book it doesn’t show the actual words and what i’m supposed to be reading it’s just a white page all throughout. I would really like to be able to read my book.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-04-27 13:06:59-07:00|You may have been wondering what the difference is between Overdrive, Libby, and Sora.  In this review I’ll explain that.Overdrive: Overdrive is the original.  Overdrive is the classic one that I was used to and I used first.  It is basically a place where you can check out ebooks and audiobooks from your local library.Libby: Libby is the new, updated version of Overdrive.  It is a place where you can check out ebooks and audiobooks from your local library, and it differs from Overdrive because it is simply the newer version.Sora: Sora is very similar to Libby, but for school.  It is a place where you can check out ebooks and audiobooks from your school library and your local library.  You have to use your school library for Sora, but you can also add your local library.Overall: Overall, Overdrive is the old one, so unless it’s the only one available to you, I wouldn’t recommend using Overdrive.  Now it’s just between Libby, and Sora, and which one you should choose really depends on you and your needs.  If you are a adult and have graduated school, use Libby.  If you are a student who likes getting ebooks from your school but also have a personal library account, I would recommend Sora.  With Sora you not only get access to ebooks from your school library, you also get ebooks from your personal local library account smushed into the same app!  It’s a great combination, and I would recommend Sora for a student.  So that’s my answer: use Overdrive if you have to, use Libby if you’ve graduated school, and use Sora if you have a school library account and/or a personal library account.And back to Sora, since this review is about Sora: I love how school and personal are smushed together into one very useful app.  Four star rating.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0
2021-04-10 16:00:46-07:00|i really like this app because they have so many different books and audiobooks.  i am able to read so many different things for free!  i also like a lot of the features like bookmarking, note taking, highlighting, achievements, holds, lists, etc, etc.  it’s also great fir reading on the go because you can download your books to read offline.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2021-04-09 08:03:38-07:00|This app is great! I can read my favorite comic series on this for free! But, I’m a little disappointed this is only for school. Like maybe you can add an option that makes it so you can use sora for personal use. I know that the point of Sora is to borrow books from school libraries, but you should really add an option for personal use somehow, like maybe make public libraries not for school use.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0

I used to use Epic! but I think this is a better app except for how glitchy it is. Thanks for the app though!Also, I don’t understand why people keep saying it’s inappropriate.

Like if it’s downloaded 51% but then u have to RESET THE FREAKING APP, it GOES BACK DOWN TO 0% DOWNLOADED!! You guys need to improve Sora, the freaking app that makes people go cray cray.

2021-01-14 08:52:14-07:00|Now that app works again, it’s a fine app but I prefer overdrive.  I wish you could sort titles by unread/read so I don’t have to scroll around looking.  Sora looks prettier but I prefer function over cutesy.  Overdrive just seems to be easier to maneuver around in & designed for phone savvy people.  Sora looks like it’s for Elementary aged kids.  Old Review from Dec 2020:  Sora worked fine this summer but about a week ago my app won’t open, it’s stuck on main screen.  I didn’t want to delete for fear of losing all the books or any saved info.  Anyone else experiencing this issue?  HELP Overdrive/Sora, you’re my only hope.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2020-12-31 12:31:06-07:00|I absolutely love all the books but maybe just maybe you could add The Dangerous Gift? It’s a Wings of Fire/WoF book!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2020-12-30 11:14:17-07:00|Hello reader, I love this app, if you are looking for an app with a large selection of e-books and audio books then this is the place for you!  I was so excited when my English teacher recommended this app to me! I love how you can also get fun little achievements for reading different genres, renewing a book, returning a book early, etc. The selection is awesome   ! My only issue with this app is the checkout limit, three books total (both your e-books and audio books combined not three each). Could the developers possibly bring it up to four, or maybe five? Thanks so much for reading! Bye!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2020-12-24 17:19:23-07:00|Okay Sora is good. I like it. It’s not their fault that they got four stars. It’s that recently I stumbled across a app called Libby and it was so good, even better than Sora. Plus, I only got Sora cause my school used it, but I realized that I can use my school library on Libby too. I am not a Libby advertiser, just a real customer, and plan on keeping Sora, but overdrive and Libby can add two libraries and allow me to navigate between my school and public libraries. This makes me use Sora less and less but overall the app is good and deserves 4 stars but if you want an exceptional five star app just get Libby and if you want two libraries get overdrive. Sora is good, maybe even great, but not as good as Libby or overdrive. I encourage you get those apps instead.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0
2020-12-19 12:32:33-07:00|It is my favorite thing to do when I get home from school I get on it right away and see no problems.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2020-12-19 05:51:20-07:00|Sora is a nice app but however, it has issues. My child was obsessed with reading on Sora when her school introduced it to her, so she read a lot everyday. However, when she opened Sora a few days later, when she wanted to borrow a book, it said, ‘You checked out and returned too many titles in a short time please try again later.’ I would get that if she did NOT return the titles, but that makes no sense because they were basically stopping my daughter from reading! And another thing Sora could be working on, my daughter can only check out one book at a time and hold one book at a time, why aren’t they letting her check out and hold more? So Sora’s a good app when you actually can read on there, otherwise, it could use some work.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2020-12-16 18:36:26-07:00|Sora is a really good app! You can read many varieties of books! You can get levels and do so many things! Too bad it’s probably only for schools. But I recommend for you to download this app!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2020-12-07 09:28:20-07:00|I love this app and all, however there is one problem I need you to fix. Well the problem is sometimes the app freezes, so then I have to close the tab and go back in the app. Please fix this, but whoever else is reading this you should get it. This problem just might be for me or because of the phone I have.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0
2020-12-06 20:31:25-07:00|My son tried to open a book numerous times, but it froze on the same page. Every. Single. Time. Please fix this!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|2.0
2020-12-03 12:29:40-07:00|This app is the worst app I have ever used. One of the experiences I had with this app is that one time I opened the book and sora said that there was only 300 pages. When I continued to read the book the total number of pages increased. When I finished reading the book it turns out that there were more than 600 pages. This app is so misleading. I had to read the book off of Sora for my book report so it took forever to read the whole thing, which I at first thought was only 300 pages. My friend also had a problem with Sora as well. She waited 3 weeks to receive her book because Sora said the book was on hold.  The book never came so she had to get it from the library instead. So ridiculous.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|1.0
2020-12-01 14:56:01-07:00|This app is amazing for all ages. There are so many good books I could read all day. There are no adds with is awesome. I do think they should add more then one or two copies of a book, but other then that it is a wow wow wow app!!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0
2020-11-26 16:24:12-07:00|I thought that I never had time to read. Turns out, I didn’t have time to find the books that I want to read. I love how Sora brings the library to my home!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2020-11-24 21:30:27-07:00|I like the app somewhat but whenever I want to read a graphic novel it either won’t load or it will completely freeze, over and over again.   I have to restart the app several times just to read a simple 200 page graphic novel.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2020-11-16 12:09:32-07:00|Major problems with this app1. Copies disappear and you aren't able to check them out at all. I had a hold on a certain book for a year, and I never got to read it.2. There isn't a good book selection. One thing that bugs me about this app is that it doesn't have a lot of new and popular books to choose from. Unless you like reading boring classics from a million years ago, there aren't a lot of newer or interesting books. I mean sure there is a few popular series and novels but they're always checked out constantly.To improve this app, I would suggest fixing the problems with the check outs, and improving the book selection.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|1.0
2020-11-12 18:43:03-07:00|I think that sora is an excellent app for all readers they have a wide variety of books for all ages|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2020-11-11 20:46:57-07:00|I am a student who uses this app to listen to audiobooks during this pandemic, but with that I have a question: Why do you need to borrow and renew audiobooks? And here’s a better one: Why can I not renew an AUDIOBOOK when someone has a hold on it? It’s not like it’s an actual book that there is only one of, in fact, why is it even like this at all? Isn’t the whole point of a virtual library to keep books easily accessible? Maybe there is something that I don’t understand, but this system is REALLY stupid. (I know I complained a lot, but it’s still good, and is still a really easy way to access good reads or listens)|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2020-11-11 12:02:12-07:00|The app wont always let me in. When i open the app it just sends me back to the home page no matter how many times i open the app. And i know of others who have the same problems with this app. It a pain.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|1.0
2020-11-11 11:51:02-07:00|I just hate reading in general and i dont know how to use the app cause it’s confusing.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|1.0

2020-08-27 05:16:07-07:00|I love this game but their are a few things you should know about it .You need more characters because I’m getting bored of doing just Santa and a Christmas tree . so there is more you should know .i love how you do their hair  and that but I think do a round of doing their clothes on the game. And last and not all back to characters  I think you should add a elf a  and mrs. claus. Please right back.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|4.0

2020-08-22 19:45:23-07:00|I really like toca boca like toca kitchen and others but this game needs more characters all it is Santa and a tree It needs mrs  clause or an elf to also I think there should be more things to do like maybe Santa or tree can rate how you do things and if you do good then you get coins and then you can by new supplies or something else overall it’s a real fun game but it needs a little work I hope toca boca will read this!|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0

2020-08-09 01:40:17-07:00|Listen I’m a kid and I was y’know looking for x mas games (for some reason) and I came across “100 ideas for elf on the shelf” I read the reviews and one said something about every year you have to make up ideas for the elf and i was heartbroken and I was looking at my moms pictures and I saw that she had a picture of her and my dad with the Christmas presents on Christmas Eve when me and miles were asleep I told my mom and she was like “well my phone glitches and maybe it was on Christmas” I kinda believe her  but like I said when I saw that app I was so heartbroken and then I came across the “call Santa app” and the reviews were  about heir children actually thinking it’s the real sant a(this has nothing to do with this game)|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|5.0

2020-04-05 19:22:18-07:00|This was the best app to get so you can send hella funny picture to your friends. However, the characters were so ugly and looked like the developers abused them. The Santa looks like someone is killing him when you use the hair dryer lol. 10/10 would recommend if you are above the age of 13. Next time try to make the characters a little uglier though.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|5.0
2020-03-16 07:55:45-07:00|It used to be were you could hurt the people then fix them up ughh|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0

2020-03-12 13:07:50-07:00|Its pretty weird. And it’s a little to hard to cut the hair.Although it’s fun to do the hair paintI wouldn’t recommend it,their are better games.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|2.0
2020-03-07 13:19:23-07:00|I just found out toca boca was a thing from my friend and she bought the hair one and I thought it was free so I come to my iPad to download it the I see it cost money so I say this and thought “this will be fun!” I was wrong there are only two characters to choose from and you can’t do everything in the other game I was not expecting it to be as good as the first one but this I don’t like|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0
2020-02-05 08:57:49-07:00|All tho It has very little selection it’s pretty good and the  was a good idea you could add an elf and a rain-dear , and on that note also more tools.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|4.0
2020-01-31 13:44:18-07:00|Hey this game is pure junk they only have two characters  my only  question is why won’t you make more I. Abosolutly think this game is so stupid this game is the worst two  thumbs down #i hate it|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0

2020-01-04 19:48:50-07:00|Needs more characters to customize. For example an elf. That is honestly it because this game is so awesome already.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|5.0
2020-01-04 18:39:03-07:00|They have their news link right over item you need to choose. My kid was having such a hard time picking certain colors or items in that corner. I tried to help but kept clicking that link as well. It was very frustrating to play, which was disappointing because my kid actually thought it was fun.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0
2019-12-26 09:51:38-07:00|Look here people might think I’m the bad guy here, but please just let me explain. I got this game which was suppose to be “fun” for my little brother. And he was so mad because you only get to do TWO people hairs!!!!! That’s insane why would you make a game which only is going to allow you to do only two peoples heads!?!?? This is ridiculous!!!|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0
2019-12-24 11:40:34-07:00|Ok, this game is 8 years old, saying it’s trash, it was last updated 2 years ago! So, please, it does need more, JUST STOP HATING ON THIS GAME!!!|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|5.0
2019-12-21 14:07:58-07:00|When I played this game I saw only 2 people..and by the way these peoples faces barley move..and there’s less stuff..why can’t you add more to this? And also make IF you add more people here’s who you should add : Mrs Claus, Frosty, an elf, and a polar bear! But work harder on this!|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0
2019-12-17 06:56:01-07:00|To a is a good app but I think that there should be more options of people to choose to do there hair but otherwise it’s a great app|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|4.0

2019-12-14 08:41:10-07:00|I didn’t like it at first but after a while it was fun.It  could be better but it is fine. Don’t listen to other people who don’t like it. Because it is so fun. I think Santa would play it too.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|3.0
2019-12-10 13:34:04-07:00|So awesome saw some it’s so fun but it needs more characters and you can’t wash the hair it also doesn’t have a girl character and basically all you can do to the tree guy is put ornaments on him|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|4.0
2019-12-04 17:04:55-07:00|It gets boring in the first minute not the best toca game I’ve played.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0
2019-11-30 07:41:13-07:00|This is my first toca boca game, so this was not a good impression on me. This just made me not want to download more of their games. It only had two characters and the graphics were just HORRIBLE, I don’t recommend this game. I know I have not played the other ones but I searched toca boca and most of the games cost money. Based on this game I don’t think that paying is worth it. Even if the graphics were HORRIBLE they could have made it more characters but NO just Santa and a Tree . Please don’t waste your time downloading this game it is not worth it.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0
2019-11-27 15:07:18-07:00|Ok, so I downloaded this game again and I was disappointed . I chose Santa and I was gonna make him look like baldi. So I use the razor AND I APPARENTLY CANNOT MAKE SAnTA BALd!!! I was extremely triggered by this and it’s a total rip off. IM DISAPPOINTED WITH TOCA ! don’t do it again|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0

2020-05-22 04:48:17-07:00|It’s a really good game but when you get out of the game it deletes your work and i was exciting about this game but when i log out I wasn’t pleased i got mad its a good game though. Can you please add a save to the game to save all your work|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2020-05-13 10:29:51-07:00|Kilobloblocks lite is a really cool game but if you get off the game it deletes all of your hard work. And unlike Minecraft you cannot play with friends, me and my cousin are always playing the game while sitting next to each other and talking while wishing we could play together. But there are a lot of good things about the game too! Like if you go on menu then press options then press flying then you press jump and forward at the same time you will fly and be able to go inside of clouds!!! Also when you get on the game there is already a house made for you. Something else cool is that when you are on walking not flying then you go in the water then press jump and forward at the same time and then you will be able to swim! And there are no dangerous things like zombies or anything. And you can never die in the game not even if you swim in lava and if you delete a hole in the ground and make it so deep it will take you to above the clouds and sun!!!!!|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2020-05-11 18:11:52-07:00|Please bring the old one back because it’s not as fun anymore|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2020-05-10 14:25:22-07:00|Now being a huge Minecraft fan I thought this would be bad but...... it’s just meh not awful just meh i like the originals blocks but it’s missing a lot just a suggestion|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2020-05-09 19:52:27-07:00|I love playing this game cuz i get to build whatever I want. but i was listening to music one time and I clicked off to change the song, when I went back on the app it deleted my work . i spent 2 hours of my time all for it to be deleted. i’m not paying 4 dollars just to have the real game for it to save my progress. what a waste of time.....|Kiloblocks Lite|2.0
2020-05-02 21:11:35-07:00|I love this game don’t get me wrong, also I’m too cheap to buy Minecraft. However, I was working on a Mansion, that took THREE HOURS just to do the floor for that matter, and I laid down my phone and my phone fell asleep so I opened the phone back up and ALL OF MY WORK WAS GONE!!You might have more users on this app if you fixed it so there’s a SAVE button, because I was reading all the other Reviews and most of them are talking about their work deleting just because they wanted to check the time or they set the phone down  to grab the TV remote and the phone fell asleep.|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2020-04-16 16:47:28-07:00|Please allow us to save our worlds in Kiloblocks LITE. It's not fair that we work so hard on a creation just to lose it cause our phone accidentally turned off. Please make an update so we can save our creations WITHOUT having to pay. Whats the big deal with Kiloblocks (the actual one) anyway? What do we pay for exactly? You guys would get better ratings if you could just add a save button to the LITE version. Plus more money if people download the game right? Just please, I'm begging you to make a save option. And I’m rating this game a 4/5 cause I really like the game.|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2020-04-15 17:08:38-07:00|I love the game even though it’s not like Minecraft but please ADD A SAVING FILE. When I want to change my music or click the home button it always resets !!! Please, it would’ve been 4 stars but 5 if animals can be added.|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2020-04-07 01:07:48-07:00|Great game overall! Only problem being that when build the game does not save any progress.|Kiloblocks Lite|2.0

2020-03-26 15:56:21-07:00|So I used to play this all the time with mg brother as a kid since my parents didn’t allow me to buy Minecraft. A few years later I look for the game and it has changed too much. I remember that it was way better than this. The old textures were better too. All my memories are dead now TwT|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2020-03-12 20:02:51-07:00|When I was a little kid I used to play Exploration lite all.the.time but then I stopped playing it because my old phone broke then I forgot about it so I decided to play it again. The next thing I know is that they re-name the title of the game so I wasn’t worried at all. When all of a sudden there is no caves, no waterfall, and other stuff their used to be. I pretty much got bored of the new Exploration lite. Another thing is that the people who made the changes of this Can you guys please make an upgrade be cause whenever I get out my stuff all disappear but still I want the old Exploration lite version BACK!!!!|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2020-03-06 06:59:39-07:00|Why is the game file so big? I played the game as a kid but the the file size got to big so I had to delete the game.|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0

2020-02-15 10:26:37-07:00|I loved exploration as a kid and I was excited to play its updates version. I was shot down quickly. No mountains. No pools of water, no islands to discover, no waterfalls, no caves. Just a stupid trailer. I was never to play exploration a lot because it didn’t support my tablet so when I saw it’s brand new version could support my phone, all the memories of me playing it flooded my mind just for me to see how bad this game is. Bring back the old exploration I loved even it would never save my stuff it was 1000 times better than this. I get headaches playing this game because of of the terrain is shaped. THAT IS NOT EARTH!!!! That is some flat shaped piece of land. Can you plz get the old exploration that can support my phone because I want it back so badly. It would be nice to add animals to this game just to enhance the experience. Like owning a farm. I don’t want kiloblocks to become a wannabe minecraft. Because I know it is different. But I am so sick kiloblocks that I am planning on getting Minecraft because it is actually interesting with different biomes and animals. I really loved the old exploration so can you please bring it back|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2020-01-29 13:45:39-07:00|I love this game even when it was called Exploration lite...and I like how it already has a house to start out with...but it needs to save, the whole point of downloading this game is so you don’t have to pay... like Minecraft...that is the point but we have to pay for full version...so not much of a difference...but thank you |Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2020-01-28 14:39:41-07:00|I love it but I was working on a bold for 3 hours and I accidentally exit out of the game and it got deleted. I’m so mad|Kiloblocks Lite|2.0

2020-01-03 17:45:10-07:00|I  L O V E this game but the Only Reason I have it a four star is because I wish it saved your progress because you can make something you like it and you want to keep it, and as soon as you go out of the app...........POOF!!! Gone! I love the game but all of that awesome work, all for literally NOTHING!! Thanks for making the game. I really do love it. Just trying to make it more enjoyable.  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!!!!|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0

2019-09-07 13:30:59-07:00|One of the good things about this game is that it’s free. Another thing is that it’s a lot like Minecraft.  Great game, keep up the good work.|Kiloblocks Lite|5.0
2019-09-03 14:13:24-07:00|It’s a great game but I can’t play with my little sister. Can you make to where we can play with other people??|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2019-08-15 17:47:16-07:00|I like this game alot but what happened to the mountains like in exploration lite can u pls put mountains|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2019-08-02 10:16:48-07:00|Ok so the thing I hate the comments reviews is because some kid built a huge house and built it and it took 10 weeks. THAT MEANS THEY WERE WASTING THEIR TIME PLAYING TEN WEEKS STRAIGHT WITHOUT TAKING A BREAK!!!!|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2019-07-25 19:18:49-07:00|I remember this game was wayyy better three years ago. It had mountains water fall everything now?? It’s just boring and doesn’t save. Put it back to the way it was with the mountains and the long distances it was way more enjoyable that way|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2019-07-22 20:44:26-07:00|The app is good but it doesn’t save your work other than that it’s good|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2019-07-14 10:00:51-07:00|I HATE that it doesn’t save my work. I go to the home screen for one second and it deleted my whole house! I am soo upset!! GET THAT FIXED I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY $3.99 JUST FOR IT TO SAVE MY WORK!!|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2019-07-13 11:57:16-07:00|It’s a really good game I love it but there is one problem, every time I build something or I’m in the middle of it it can’t save there is no option to save and it doesn’t automatically save you have to start all over again|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2019-07-11 16:39:00-07:00|So, I ran into this game yesterday and I immediately saw a flaw with it. So when you log into the game you have blocks in your face. I know it’s not a big problem but the next problem is bigger and will aggravate most players. IT DOSE NOT SAVE PROGRESS!!! And last and also least I would play it more often if it had more items like food, beds you can get in and sleep in mobs and animals oh, yeah and also books. So just every day items that you would find in a house.                                                       PS: This game is kinda a knockoff Minecraft and would definitely rate it 5 yes I said five stars if it gets updated.|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2019-07-09 17:46:32-07:00|You made that update where like everything was either up or down the water was down and you had to jump a plane fly up the block stand is just pretty boring because like last time there was like mountains in like thanks for your time bye|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2019-07-06 21:21:57-07:00|Bad game! It deleted all my hard work! I will never download this game again and I’m telling all my friends to delete this game |Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2019-06-29 14:22:42-07:00|This app doesn’t save anything if u go out of the app it’s a waste I would recommend get a different app and not this one :/ it’s a lot of waste of your day and time|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2019-06-26 07:17:50-07:00|This is fun but it doesn’t save can you do something about it plz|Kiloblocks Lite|2.0
2019-06-08 18:30:23-07:00|I love this game, just every time you go out the game your progress is ruined.I spend hours making a house and I did it for nothing.Also I think they should add more blocks. This makes it easier to build. Its because sometimes I try to build something but I can’t because I don’t have the right blocks for it.|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2019-06-06 14:39:22-07:00|ok so this game is fine in general but i wish the terrain had more mountains and caves|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2019-06-04 17:32:00-07:00|I think I have no idea what this game is about and it is a waste of space on the App Store but I barely remember playing it when I was younger, but that was pretty much ancient times compared to now. This could be a primitive version of Minecraft but this was an example of the crappy games before things got real in the App Store so that’s why I hate zero stars.Ps. Your need milk|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2019-06-02 16:27:50-07:00|Honestly this is a really fun game! I like it a lot better than minecraft but i (and i cannot stress this enough) HATE THAT YOUR WORK ISNT SAVED. Please please fix this, it’s awful and I want to be able to build something and then exit the app and then come back to add to it another time. please fix it!!|Kiloblocks Lite|2.0
2019-05-31 11:44:31-07:00|I BUILT A HUGE HOUSE AND WHEN I PRESSED THE HOME BUTTOM IT JUST LITTURALLY RESTARTED IF YOU WONT FIX I WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO NOT TO INSTALL THAT DARN GAME!!FIX GAME!!!|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2019-05-29 07:18:51-07:00|This game is fun but it definitely has issues. First you start with block of gravel in your face! Then you realize that the building or house you spent so much time working on has been deleted !!! I am just going to delete this app and I will not start playing again when they fix this annoying problem.|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2019-05-22 04:08:28-07:00|For the fix you need to make people sleep in the beds because I can’t sleep in the beds there’s other furniture and it’s my first time playing this so I think you should this fix anytime|Kiloblocks Lite|5.0
2019-05-21 16:48:01-07:00|Ok, 1, CAN YOU READ!? It says Kiloblocks/ Exploration LITE! News flash : LITE means DOWNGRADED VERSION (or something like that). If you want the save version, then pay money to get it. If you spend so much time on you little projects, then just spend a couple dollars and get the full, save-avalible game.             This game is really nice I like how it consumes our time. Thank you for making this game!!              |Kiloblocks Lite|5.0
2019-05-04 11:43:32-07:00|it's an okay game... it doesn't save you're progresswhich is stupid but its kinda fun. if you don't have that much storage on your phone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD. it's a waste|Kiloblocks Lite|2.0
2021-08-21 11:35:31-07:00|This isn’t the app Toca boca tho. If you search up it. It’s an whole another game. And this app is FREE. Maybe they changed it? I don’t reallly understand these reviews|Toca Kitchen Monsters|4.0
2021-08-16 18:45:02-07:00|So I have given this game a 5 star review because I  want you to see this. I used to have  Toca Kitchen before they charged you. This game is scary and wouldn’t recommend for little kids so like ages 3-11yrs like this game is disturbing. I don’t recommend. This isn’t a good game I need you guys too see this though.(it might not be as bad if your a but older than 10 though)|Toca Kitchen Monsters|5.0
2021-08-16 13:49:26-07:00|This is ment for kids…. but ITS ALL ICKY AND DIRTY I KNOW ITS “MONSTER BUT PLS IT ICKY” AND THE OTHER ONE HAS A MONSTER BUT THE KITCHEN IS STILL CLEAN >:( THE PLACE IS ICKY AND DIRTY >:(|Toca Kitchen Monsters|1.0

2021-07-10 14:23:13-07:00|I’ve played these games since 2015…I’m 12 and still play them here-and-there but, I download these for my younger sisters now… These games are super entertaining and fun for the family! Unlike Mica town (It’s Miga town but, it feels wrong saying that) Anyways, you guys are so creative and make sure to make it friendly for your demographic, thank you so much for that! Your a flawless company, it can get a little pricey…I recommend making your in-app purchases maybe 0.25 - 1.00 $ cheaper. Other than that, your amazing. Parents, I recommend downloading this.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|5.0
2021-07-04 18:00:41-07:00|I don’t like Toca monster I like Toca kitchen better and Toca kitchen 2|Toca Kitchen Monsters|1.0
2021-07-02 19:58:33-07:00|why I just want the Toca kitchen for free why does the monsters look so creepy|Toca Kitchen Monsters|1.0
2021-07-02 12:24:00-07:00|So I got this app because the other toca boca kitchen game costed money and I used to have that version before they made it money I don’t like this version there’s not much to choose from AT ALL if u want a better kitchen game then to second one is the way to go|Toca Kitchen Monsters|3.0
2021-07-02 08:36:56-07:00|Dude this is boring and the other version of this was free and better now you hav Sri pay money for the better version |Toca Kitchen Monsters|3.0
2021-06-27 08:43:01-07:00|I haven’t had this game for too long and its already boring. Theres only two monster and the blue one won’t eat broccoli and the brown one won’t eat tomatoes. Which is annoying. Theres also a limited selection of food, and theres a limited selection of appliances. Like I really want to cook something in the oven, but theres no oven, and if I want to make one of the monsters a drink, hey, theres no way to make one. You get bored really easily because theres hardly anything to do.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|1.0
2021-06-24 16:30:40-07:00|This is the best game I love this game it so fun and and so much fun I can play this game for hours|Toca Kitchen Monsters|5.0
2021-06-16 16:41:20-07:00|This game is really fun but after a while, it gets kinda boring, it tells you how to cook the food and makes you do it there way, i wish they would let you do stuff by yourself. And I wish we could get more food, other then that it’s fun.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|3.0
2021-06-07 11:58:18-07:00|The reason I put 2 stars instead of 5 is because this game is the only kitchen app from Toca that I can get while the others cost money. I had this app for a couple of seconds and deleted it because there were only 2 CHARACTERS and when u cook u can’t do anything like add seasoning, extra foods, etc. I think I used to have the Toca app that costed 3.99 but it used to NOT cost money, it was free until now I also have a rating for Toca boca and is that I can’t get much things because they are costing which is my concern bc I’m not a person who wants to pay money on a stupid app that I’m not gonna use for long. I’m actually pretty upset of these games but atleast I can still play Toca boca and this.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|2.0
2021-06-06 16:45:27-07:00|I have played befor and I will just ask can you addd more of the monsters?|Toca Kitchen Monsters|4.0

I posted a question earlier and all I got was a spam answer which was a waste of my time and a question that I pay for. When I messaged support at first they just gave me a scripted answer that didn’t even answer the question I asked. I had to keep telling them the problem until they gave me my question back and just told me to post the question again. When I asked what to do if it happened again they just said to follow the question guide for posting. (So helpful) Their customer service is lacking and how they handle question posts most of the time is just sad. For each question you post you only get 1 answer and sometimes it doesn’t even answer the question. Even if you say it wasn’t an answer to the question they won’t send a new “Expert” to re answer your question which is stupid. That’s a huge flaw for them in my opinion.

Don’t use it on the phone, and if you do it on the website and have more than one tab open, it will do the same. Don’t waste your money. Worst app ever.

2022-01-10 08:17:25-07:00|When the app is working properly, it works wonders which is why they got stars at all. I am constantly being logged out of my account and restricted from it over bogus claims. “Uh oh this account has been restricted due to an unusual amount of activity.” OBVIOUSLY I’M USING WHAT I PAID FOR. I cannot wait until May to cancel this account and never get charged for something that questions me EVERY TIME I use it. So frustrating. I am only using one device & never let others use my account. I am doing my part and paying $20 monthly to use this app yet Chegg can’t get it together enough for me to actually use what I pay for!!!! Stop logging me out, making me change my passwords, verify devices, etc. IT’S STILL ME. Sincerely, a frustrated college student. |Chegg Study - Homework Help|2.0
2022-01-08 07:55:59-07:00|Sure, Chegg might help you get some answers right, if you can even use your account. They make you pay to use Chegg, and yet somehow more than half the time I can’t even get into my account because of “errors” or “failing to authenticate.” I’ve changed my password several times. I’ve linked my google to it. I don’t ever log out and yet I’m always struggling to get back into my account. The “verification” they make you do to prove you aren’t a robot doesn’t work half the time, either. In my opinion, Chegg is overall a scam to get you to pay and then make it as difficult as possible for you to use your account. $15 and for what? I will be cancelling my subscription and never using Chegg again, and I would suggest sticking to Quizlet or Course Hero instead. Anything but Chegg.|Chegg Study - Homework Help|1.0

2021-12-28 13:10:29-07:00|Cons -It has a limit of only 2 device which is completely ironic , keeping in mind I’m the one paying for the app and should be able to use as many device as I’d like to … this can be a hassle while in a timed assignment because you then have to try to swap it out which is almost not possible . -Almost every time that I sign in, it ask for a verification code that’s sent via email ,which has become very annoying -After canceling you can still be charged, I’ve canceled my account before and still received charges for an entire summer break and even my previous semester of 2021, which means this is an ongoing problem and it hasn’t been fixed, however, I was able to get a refund/ dispute my charges when I wasn’t able to get a resolution from their  customer service team -Pros, you can get help with difficult classes for instance maths , physic , bio and Chem however I would suggest not using it to get help for essay writings, writing aren’t authentic and usually copied  from somewhere which can result in plagiarism .|Chegg Study - Homework Help|3.0

As someone who owns multiple devices I must say I absolutely HATE how we are only allowed 2 registered devices. For instance, say I post a question on the app and I have a question for the person who kindly took on my question, I am unable to may any comment and must go to a web browser to just make a comment, very inconvenient.. along with that I have the app on my iPad and my laptop registered as my 2 devices for the service, I recently came home for break and left my laptop at my apartment since it is an inconvenient to bring to and from my apartment and we are on break and the homework I have on break is material I am able to do on my iPad. But since my laptop is back at my apartment I had to use the web browser to log into Chegg just to post my comment which I then had to register the iPad again to the service and waste my monthly device swap which they only give you 1 swap for each month.

It helped me so much with chemistry but then after a month EVERY SINGLE TIME I used it I’d get kicked out and told “uh-oh looks like you’ve been sharing your account”. There were days I was on it for only 1 minute and it would tell me that and they wouldn’t reinstate my account until 2 days later. It got super annoying because it hit a point where I was paying for it yet not even able to use it because of how many times they deactivated my account. Then I contacted them and they told me I can’t be logged in on my phone and laptop at the same time, so I logged out of the laptop. Then I got my account deactivated again and they said it’s because if I work and live in different cities the location will pick up as if someone else is using my account -_-.

Yet I’m your game that tries to be “realistic” it’s only 4 train cars! This makes me mad because you just made it so unrealistic. I’ll give 5 stars when I see a 10-15 train car long train. And maybe add a horn for the train, and a more realistic crossing please. I’ll give 4 stars for the new amazing city. It’s beautiful. But again. THE TRAINS ARE TO SHORT! I thought I talked about this last time. But please. Make them 10-15 cars long. And maybe add a American railroad crossing with bells and just more realistic. And again a train horn please.

This is very annoying, because I lose the level and have to start over again.It honestly makes me wanna delete the game in general.

There are some really good cars in this game like with cool white paint jobs and I just feel that people who worked on this tackle the time and making the game feel like a regular simulator and it’s also fun to drive when I’m not even actually allowed to drive yet so it’s fun to like see what grown-ups are feeling I like this game because again I feel like it but you feel kind of feel like if you’re not already in adult and if you’re an outlet adult then can I just make what do you take A break and I think it’s really nice so I really suggest you play this game also the other games that they made |Driving Academy 2021 Simulator|5.0

2022-02-19 20:28:55-07:00|Why does almost everything thing have to be vip ???Do you really expect children to be able to by this?please change this :)|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-19 19:59:20-07:00|I love the game it is so much fun to play but why do you have to be a vip to get the family and all of them why do you get Barbie  I play it after I get out of school my sister love it so much and so do I to so not so much |Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-19 19:50:29-07:00|I do not like how you can not give your little people who do the fashion runway and the little pictures you can not change their outfits|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-19 11:50:49-07:00|I love this game but seriously, you have to get rid of the vip. It would be way more fun to play around with ALL of the characters. Please if you can, no VIP!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-19 06:51:49-07:00|Like really to much vip I can’t do anything on the app|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0

2022-02-18 20:09:00-07:00|I was playing this game and I was buying clothes. And suddenly out of nowhere my feet are gone my body turns pink and gives me some kind of thing this game is the worst game I’ve ever played in my life you have to change it up and maybe even give a places to go |Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0
2022-02-18 19:44:18-07:00|I like the app I do have vip but it is SO expensive so plz bring the price lower. Right now it is 6.20!  I understand you have to make money, but if you think about it if you lower the price more people will buy it and you will make about the same amount of money.1. I also think you should have a school!2.You should add a gym for all different kinds of sports3.You should give more options to people who don’t have the VIP4. Make Kens house 5. What happened to the Weirdenns? ( barbies neighbor)Can you add them in the game   6. Can you add parents room?|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-18 19:26:31-07:00|"As a child,I grew up with barbie,she was all I would play with.Honestly,for a childrens game this is rubbish.Making kids spend their own allounce on a game?I am disgusted.Today,my daughter cam crying to me and said""mommy mommy,barbie keeps asking me for money.Its just disappointed.Barbie was my childhood.I am disgusuted by how they treat barbie these days.I dont reccomend this game.Just play with your own children.Sincerly,cece"|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-18 18:42:40-07:00|My 6 year old daughter Melinda was playing this and in 23 seconds she cries about the VIP. Well I brought it for her and then she cried about something else. She picked up Teresa and a puppy to make them dance and all of a sudden Teresa's face opened and moved crazy glitching. Then she picked up the cat to dance and it's face moved away from her body and started rotating. Please fix these. Oh another glitch. When i tried to get something cute ( I wanted to get the whole outfit I have 99,003,628,627 coins.) When I got the outfit and went out, Barbie's body except her face turned pink and her head opened and she had a scary face my sweet Meli screamed. 2. Why in the world don't we get decorations for Valentine's day. My friends Valencia and Aleecia Katrina don't like this. Kennalee hates this too! And I hate you. Have a bad day! Also don't listen to the good reviews they are tricking you|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-18 14:15:07-07:00|This game is so awesome  I love it because I am a VIP and it took me years to beg my parents and finally they let me be a VIP!!!! There are a couple of questions. I know that Skipper and Stacie’s room is here now but I shouldn’t lie that part is awesome  but I saw this door and I was wondering if that was there parents room. But if that is the case then can you tell me?I just am so thankful that you made this game it is sooooo much fun.Please tell me if it is their parents room ok? Sincerely Arwa|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-18 14:05:27-07:00|I love the game In all but I think you should take out the vip I mean like it’s just not fair to me.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0

2022-02-17 12:26:29-07:00|I like this game but y’all put too much money in it. People don’t like that and neither do I, please lower your prices. And I don’t like how you just give people 2 characters We need you to change 2 characters to 10 or 9 characters. Whatever your gonna do to the game please make it at least a lower price and more characters this time!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0
2022-02-17 10:10:20-07:00|I kinda don’t like this game for my children because they want Chelsea in and the other people but you have to buy it and it’s only for a month and if you could just open everything for free that would be good and I will give you a five star I like this game though|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0
2022-02-17 02:14:39-07:00|The game looks good. I have a suggestion GET RID OF VIP. Almost everything is vip (You almost need vip to play the game) You guys should make all the characters and the musical instruments and all customization options free and leave the rest for vip|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-16 17:06:16-07:00|We love this game but why can’t we just buy it for a time time fee.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-15 15:39:59-07:00|I love this game but can you please make the boys a room but I feel like they’re left out without a room I love all the houses in the dream house would be nice if you had a camper so you can travel to different places like in the movies like to the cities beach and everything else please respond to this this is a great game even though I don’t like Barbies I still played this game cause I think it’s really cool.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-15 13:08:31-07:00|TO MUCH VIP BOOOOOOO PLEASE PLEASE READ BOOOOOOOOOO WHY MAKE THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE YO BY EVRYTHING !!!!!!!!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0
2022-02-14 22:35:43-07:00|I love this game just a few issues 1: Too much VIP i really want more characters and outfits and stuff can there be more free stuff pls and there is a bug every time i go into barbie gram it kicks me out of the app other than that this game is great!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-14 17:34:52-07:00|You should probably do something about your price it’s so pricey but here’s a tip for everyone delete the game and then download it back and you get everything for free even the VIP passes|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-13 17:48:06-07:00|Why do you guys not have Chelsea,Stacie, and skipper unlocked because we can have Barbie but not the other sisters so please please please consider having all the sisters unlocked!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-13 15:19:51-07:00|I was starting to play this game I thought it was OK but after a few years it turned out to be great awesome you could do anything with Barbie so that’s why try this game and you can be anything that’s all I get this five stars anyway goodbye and if you do play this game and be the best person ever XOXO By Blair|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-13 15:08:40-07:00|The game had something going on with it so to start the vip thing   Was a little bit ekspath so i could not get the vip mode |Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-13 08:59:48-07:00|I’ve had this game for a while now and I love it but, there’s way to mush VIP! I mean we only get 2 characters and you can barely do anything! I also think that you should add the parents room, even though you never see it in the show I think you have a pretty good idea of what it would look like.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-13 08:32:24-07:00|This game is so much fun but there is to much vip at least don’t make the characters vip|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-13 04:16:22-07:00|It is really fun there is a lot of secret places in the Dreamhouse but there are some glitches.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-12 22:32:47-07:00|The Dreamhouse is amazing but we need a party room and one more option in Barbie's room; A slide and the side where the pool is, 2 more requests: I think that Chelsea's room should have an animal-care room where she takes care of her pets,1 more option; you should actually have Brooklyn and Emmie have rooms, one is floor 5 and the other one is floor 6, Add those please!!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-12 16:05:27-07:00|plz take off VIP its annoying and TOO EXPENSIVE|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-12 15:34:32-07:00|It’s good but I hate how most of the things in it is VIP. You should be able to unlock things. Please respond to me|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-12 12:54:25-07:00|Ok I love this game but the membership should cost 2.99 and should only have to be paid once also you should be able to move two characters at once also you should have more characters without membership but it is an overall good game I hope you take my advice thanks and for readers I suggest downloading it|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-12 09:04:25-07:00|This is advertised as a free app, but the first thing that pops up when you start the game is a warning that this a VERY short trial and everything past that must be purchased|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-11 17:22:52-07:00|Bruh this game could have been so much better with less vip items ‘cuz you can barely even play the game without having to pay vip so I’m mad about that. So I suggest that you make less things vip so people can actually enjoy the game.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-11 17:12:20-07:00|6.99/mo is ridiculous. I’d pay a one time fee of $10. Not worth more than that.  You can’t do anything really in the free version. Definitely pass on this one.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-11 14:44:31-07:00|I love this game so many things to do! You can cook and change the clothes and more! So many things I could do it for days. But like a lot of other people said to much VIP! Just to much!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-10 14:35:13-07:00|Loving it |Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-10 12:50:57-07:00|So  I get you need to make money but some people can’t afford this and I used to have this game and I really liked it but it needs improvement ok I no I no I know I’m being kind of rude but STOP.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0
2022-02-09 23:44:56-07:00|I like this game but why do you have to pay for everything at once? Why can’t we just like, but an individual thing and not the whole thing that makes us pay $7 a month? This game is mainly for children who can’t just pay $7 a month for a game they like. Please fix this, or at least fix how expensive it is. And I’ve already had this game before and I got a free trial for the vip, because it said I could cancel it anytime. But it wouldn’t let me, and that made me really mad. I’m not a Karen, but please fix this.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-09 17:50:50-07:00|I think that you should be able to play with whatever Barbie you want and it not be vip or the castle people will stop playing if you don’t change this it so boring with vip I have this game since I was 6 and now I’m nine and my 4 year old sister once to play but their so much vip that she can barely to anything pleas fix this it would be better if you did thank for reading|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-09 14:40:22-07:00|Hi so I was wondering if you could please please make a mermaid thing like at the beach please idc if it’s vip I just want a mermaid thing 2 a character like you can make your own character it would be amazing  please 3 you can make your own house it can be small or something idc put it in a shop just please ok so that’s all I have sorry if it’s so much stuff|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0

2021-12-19 09:56:16-07:00|The app is great, giving translations and words in context to help me chose the right word.  I love it.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0

2021-12-16 19:16:40-07:00|I love this app because it offers you 3 choices of translations, and the ease in which you can look up the meaning of a word, and examples of its common usages.  I wish it had more space to type a short paragraph, as I use it frequently for conversation via text messages.  This App is more accurate in Spanish (Mexico) to English translation than Google Translate (GT).  I have caught many embarrassing mistakes on GT by double-checking on this App.  One time using GT, I almost asked my gardener to marry me.  Luckily, I knew the translation didn’t look right and double checked here.  Ever since then, I say “when in doubt, check it out!”|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0
2021-12-16 15:18:04-07:00|I really love this Spanish translator app. I am learning Spanish, and it is incredibly helpful. It does more than just translate. It also shows you conjugations, grammar, context, tenses etc. When you search a word, it tells you how to use it, and in which contexts it is applicable. It also shows you many different words with similar meanings so you can find just what your looking for. It even tells you what words mean regionally. It’s amazing!!! Definitely recommend!!!|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0

2021-12-04 02:17:18-07:00|So much better than the last time I used this app. They updated the interface so it is much more accessible and less laggy to use and not too mention way more responsive. There are ads but they only last 5 seconds and don’t take away from the experience.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0
2021-12-02 16:44:10-07:00|Terrific app.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0
2021-12-01 12:36:07-07:00|this app has everything you need of your learning or planning on learning the correct words and terms in Spanish, highly recommend.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0
2021-12-01 08:07:32-07:00|This is, by far, one of the best apps I’ve used in my life in general, but more specifically it is a fantastic dictionary that informs better than others, simply because they have example sentences that finish the work that definitions and translations can’t by themselves. Seeing a word in context is the greatest strength of this app. The picture of the day of different places in the Hispano sphere are all beautiful and the word of the day is always an off-the-beaten path choice compared to other word of the days that I have followed. And they are often seasonally relevant, too. And finally, it has a very informative grammar section which again, illustrates well through examples. It is my first go-to for anything I want to know about Spanish. I use it almost daily|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0
2021-11-28 21:56:15-07:00|I am a beginner in Spanish and for me the words are not very useful. They are better for intermediate students|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|4.0

2021-11-08 23:16:45-07:00|Pretty much my title. I’ve been using this app for a while and one thing I’ve noticed is just how unstable it gets when you start building vocabulary lists. It’ll just freeze. It would otherwise be an amazing app|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|1.0

2021-11-05 22:38:28-07:00|From the very first moment that I started using this app I was hooked. It’s so fun, and at times I can’t believe that me, I’m learning Spanish, all of these cool words and phrases, and I’m getting it. Another thing that I really like about this app is that I get to choose the genres that I’m most interested in  like: basic words, tableware, body parts, answers to questions, things to say in a restaurant and much more … it’s awesome!  I love it!!Thank you so much :)|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0

2021-11-02 17:27:52-07:00|This is my favorite Spanish dictionary because it has more descriptions of words with multiple uses than others that I have seen. However, the app is slow to start up (although I do feel that it has gotten better over time). What I dislike most about the app, though, is the keyboard for the vocabulary practice. Please change it to the normal Apple keyboard.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|3.0

2021-10-25 18:19:01-07:00|I mostly use this to look up words & practice vocab lists for school. I used to have to write every word on the list in here from Quizlet and so I was so happy when I found the import feature. Now I’ve gotten all entitled with it and see improvements to their vocab list feature that y’all can pls consider  Also viva la voice review btw so good, lets me turn menial tasks into review time & study more. Ok so: *Please add import feature on phone. *Please let us choose the accent of the prompts. A British person saying a word often makes me think it’s a different one. *I even have trouble understanding the word the American speakers say sometimes, that’s another thing. Maybe add something like “verb, noun, etc” Bc it happens so often where my time is wasted Bc it’s hard to understand what they want ie: “Well” “La fuente” “no, Pues” *The pics do help to provide context but the whole point of voice review is to not look at your phone & for it to be hands free (oh btw y’all’s picture for “church” is the Latter Day Saint San Diego temple, but no complaints, it’s good to see! Y’all are sharing it with so many yas!! Hahaha) *So this is a problem in-school Spanish in general: the course material is very formal and unrealistic and has you talking like the old people who write textbooks. To add to the problem my teacher is really finnicky & insists that her words are the right words & if we don’t use them we’re cheating. So can you make it easier to change the translations of words, for example: Escaparate: Real life: a window Spanish according to my teacher: window shopping I know that seems like a small difference, but when your teacher doesn’t do partial credit on tests, one wrong letter on a translation can make you fail a whole test.   So please let us easily change words without having to delete them & re add them to the list so we’re not learning the wrong translation for class without knowing it. It’s hard to keep track of “class words” and “real life words” and they shouldn’t be different but...c’est la vie I guess *You know how on the homepage you can click “vocab quiz” and it quizzes your whole list? Super cool! Could you make a “priority list” feature tho for the app homepage so I can, for example, practice my brand new list from school *Pls have the grammar lessons on the phone they are so good & helpful!! And finally just a life idea I saw that someone on your team is into Portuguese and lollll that’s actually kinda what sparked me to learn it like “you can do both yay” so a Portuguese version of SpanishDict would be TOP! Y’all made ingles.com so... Ik that’s a huge project. But like if y’all got time burning a whole in your pocket ... Viva Brazil!  Ok and that’s all thank y’all so much! Best Spanish app and uh if y’all could change your name so it doesn’t sound like the d word that would also be awesome so!!!|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0

2021-10-22 06:46:34-07:00|I have been using SpanishDict for about four years. I don’t know what I would do without it. I rely on it every single day, and I can’t say enough good about it. The verb conjugations are the absolute best, and I refer to them every day as I’m studying and trying to understand the various verbs and how they are conjugated in the various tenses. Please keep up the good work as you are making a difference for those of us trying to learn the Spanish language. KUDOS to all of you .

2021-10-18 16:17:04-07:00|Would’ve given it five stars if it weren’t for the confusing mitch match of vocab words in playlists (for instance, you could be given “all good” to translate, even though there’s multiple versions of said translation and are often included IN the same playlist, making it a guessing game for which definition is correct (often times the pictures don’t help much either.)

We tried the Nick Jr app but could only access one episode a month. Annoying! Then we saw the Noggin app. It looked like we’d have to pay for access but that was fine. She’d be able to access all 30+ episodes of the show and I had no problem paying for that. Except no. We only get a handful of episodes. Why?

This is not the case with Noggin. You cannot visit noggin.com to watch this content, and in fact there is no way to access it on a TV that isn’t a Roku or hooked up to an Apple TV. I have my TV connected to my computer and can access every other streaming service just fine via web browser or desktop application, but Noggin only offers a separate $8 subscription to their “Amazon Prime Video Channel” which you would think would be included with this subscription, but it’s not. I digress, the advertising is misleading or at the very least not clear. Most would expect normal streaming services with such an expensive monthly fee.|Noggin Preschool Learning App|1.0

2021-04-21 19:45:41-07:00|The iOS version of this app is absolutely inferior to the Fire TV version. First, the videos frequently lock up and my kids are frequently frustrated with staring at a black screen with a circular arrow spinning endlessly. This only happens on my Apple TV HD but not on my Fire TV 4K. Second the organization of shows is absolute garbage compared to the Fire TV version. The iOS version just displays a bunch of shows in a linear order with no particular set order interspersed with random music videos. At least the Fire TV version has it arranged by seasons so you can consistently figure out how to find the next episodes instead of constantly scrolling until you find the episodes you want. Overall I’ve found the Apple TV version of Noggin to be awful after using it on a Fire TV. Their Apple TV developers need to try a lot harder.|Noggin Preschool Learning App|1.0

Was provided an obnoxious “work around” which worked one time and then the app wouldn’t open again. THIS SUBSCRIPTION IS EXPENSIVE!  To have an app that won’t even load when I’m paying this much is theft. The email I got back from support: “We read and review all the comments we receive about NOGGIN and use them to improve your experience and add new features.It sounds like you haven't had an ideal experience and I'm very sorry to hear that! We are working to fix this issue and to reduce any frustrating aspects with the app.Thank you for taking the time to send us your thoughts.”Yeah. I’d say it hasn’t been a great experience.

2021-03-04 14:48:04-07:00|"UGH. So we canceled cable last week hoping that subscriptions to Prime TV, Noggin, and a handful of others would make up for it, which it mostly did. We planned it all out to be able to watch all our shows. I subscribed to Noggin because I saw that my daughter's two FAVORITE shows were included (Peppa Pig and Blues Clues & You). And at $7.99 a month, having those along with the tablet app with games and ebooks would be worth itWELL.... I went to play Blue's Clues and You on our TV and only ONE episode played. Everything else showed PURCHASE OPTIONS to buy the seasons and episodes?? HORRIBLY misleading. It was so sad that my two year old go super excited to see me selecting her show on TV and started chanting ""Blues Clues!"" only for me to have to say ""no baby I'm so sorry, we don't have it"". Life is full of disappointments, little one.Overall the app is good, she loves the games and ebooks and can at least watch Peppa Pig.I chatted customer support thinking this was an error and apparently it's not. They are misleading on purpose is my guess. I'm really considering canceling because it was 50% of our reason to subscribe but she loves the app and Peppa. Maybe it's time to get her into Disney instead :("|Noggin Preschool Learning App|3.0

2021-11-25 00:07:22-07:00|I very much enjoy this game. I do a full set of five every night. It stays fairly challenging (usually), and has a good balance of common and esoteric knowledge. Easy to play free. Ads aren’t too bad, rewards are great for just playing a bit and keeping a streak. Even the cost of playing without ads isn’t prohibitive. In terms of problems, the only thing keeping it from five stars is the unpredictability of what letters will fill in what. If I know four of five answers, it isn’t fun to have all of those basically fill in, but to have no letters to help in another word. Also… so many questions about fish and marine life, guys (especially sea slugs for some reason).

Would not recommend for kids who are too young to search these references. Biggest irk playing this game is the changing of word tense. The questions are always in singular present tense so the endings should match.

2020-06-06 10:18:20-07:00|Loved this game & played it for several years,  but since the last update, after I pass a level it opens to a blank orange screen for days & days. I’ve tried exiting completely, rebooting phone, etc to no avail. As near as I can tell, a great game was ruined by an update.UPDATE: found a workaround that works! (Thanks, Mdwychoff.) Turn off WI-FI & cellular data, open the app & it works.  Then immediately go back & re-enable Wi-Fi & cellular data. Irritating as heck, but at least it works. I upped from 1 star to 2 based on another player figuring out the workaround. Given the number of people reporting this issue, really surprised it hasn’t been fixed by now.|WordWhizzle Search|2.0

2020-05-26 17:08:46-07:00|This game is great! If you are complaining Bantu the ads, they are appearing because it is a free game.

My only thing is it would be super helpful if the graph included a point for the point of inflection. But seriously, great app!|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0
2019-09-05 20:32:12-07:00|The fact that if you insert a division symbol into an equation it automatically makes the denominator a blank box is ridiculous. I need to be able to place an in-line division symbol, so I don’t have to retype everything in the box.... and I seem not to be able to copy or paste things in the app for some reason|Desmos Graphing Calculator|2.0

2019-07-25 06:10:44-07:00|I’ve been trying various graphing calculator apps. This is the best one I’ve found. The online tutorials are great. There is so much functionality built in that I would highly recommend reviewing the tutorials. My search for a Calc is over.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0
2019-06-11 15:36:02-07:00|After trying all the different graphing calculator apps available here I finally ran into Desmos this week. I can’t believe it, this app is awesome for my calculus work, better than any of the paid calculators here. My only suggestion would be a floating input panel, because when using on an iPad in portrait view, the input is at the very bottom and very small.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0

2019-05-23 19:31:08-07:00|The app works great and graphs lines flawlessly but on my iPhone X the top and bottom of the display are cut off so if that could be fixed in a later update that would be great|Desmos Graphing Calculator|4.0
2019-05-05 13:02:48-07:00|Maybe I'm incompetent, but when you're dividing things in the app and it's in a decimal form there's no option to turn it into a fraction like on the website. It's a little irritating, but other than that it works great.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|4.0
2019-04-28 10:43:15-07:00|I’ll admit, demos is a great app. But when I graph a picture and press save It doesn’t actually save. When I press save and go out of the app, the next day everything that I “saved” is literally gone.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|3.0

2019-01-12 21:18:15-07:00|Disclaimer:  not an expert.  Using a graphical calculator first time in my life.  For all I care, I carry functionality with me in the same device I use to browse the web, text, call and communicate with others.  As far as I can tell the functionality is super intuitive and seems to be working along with my exercises in the college level book I am reading.  Terrific tool indeed!|Desmos Graphing Calculator|4.0
2019-01-02 13:25:35-07:00|It is leagues beyond traditional calculators in schools, TI-73, TI-84, TI-83 are all nothing compared to this FREE phone app. It can make and hold simple variables, graph almost anything, and has easy to understand messages to show errors. It is the only calculator I trust to make and manage phone calls.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0
2018-12-22 10:33:58-07:00|This is the best graphing app on the store however updates containing new features are scarce. I think support for more greek letters as variables would be great, as well as an option to whether, for example, π or e are treated as constants or variables. The Lambert W Function would be awesome (F⁻¹(xe^x)) and also the Riemann Zeta Function (convergence of sum of 1/n^x from n=0 to infinity). The ability to put minuses and plusses in subscript. The addition of the gamma constant ~0.577 and the omega constant which is the principle solution to 1 = xe^x.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0

2018-12-07 08:19:44-07:00|This is an excellent app. Help you all the time and you can see the points in the graphic, really helps when you are looking how many zeros there are in the equations.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0

2018-10-30 12:46:44-07:00|I’ve frequently used this app all through high school and college, and found it pretty useful save for one relatively minor flaw. When using it on an iPad Pro, I’d rather be able to use a Smart Keyboard than the in-app keyboard to type stuff in, especially since I don’t have to switch modes somehow to type letters instead of numbers. Hopefully a later version can account for this.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|4.0
2018-10-22 15:21:37-07:00|This app is helpful and amazing. I just think we should be able to draw lines or connect points with a line. That would be the best. That’s all.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|4.0

I would want you to insert a outfit creator island which requires your level to be 15 or higher. As your design your outfit you answer math questions. If you get a question wrong it does nothing. You can get only a few stars if you make a outfit, the amount would depend on level.

2022-01-27 12:13:26-07:00|I am 13 years old and I still play this game! I am giving it four stars because I have florafox as an epic, and the update where you evolve the epics does not have florafox as an option! Don’t get me wrong, great game, but I would like more chat options. One of the chat options is “Crud” but we can’t say anything else? At least have a, “Come to my house!” Or something like that. I would recommend adding trading in there and having an option where you can have a parent approve it. I am so happy you added the ban option for the game. Now we can finally stop comparing ourselves to hackers. I do have one complaint about this though. People keep reporting me! I am a really good player and I have a lot of rare items, but that’s only because I’m a really old player! I was around when the lost island was still around. I’m really upset that people keep doing this.And not to mention how people use the chat options. I was looking for some hackers to report, and then a guy asked me to follow him. I already know that he wanted me to come to his house so I did. He was there and then said come here when he was on the bed. Then he started dancing and saying pet names that could be used for something else. This is not appropriate at all! I don’t know how you could fix this, but I would like some feedback on my comment.This game could use some improvements, and it could update some stuff, but other than that, I still enjoy this game.-Lily Mythgem. (Yes I used my prodigy name. Deal with it.)|Prodigy: Kids Math Game|4.0
2022-01-26 18:07:52-07:00|Seriously I love this game but can you add more outfits and at the pet shop can you add more pets that are not just members only and plus Servey never has questions. That’s it but overall I love it!|Prodigy: Kids Math Game|5.0

2022-01-21 07:11:18-07:00|Prodigy has math magic to make kids love math! It’s an awesome game to play even when you’re bored. Sometimes I like to think of it as a normal game! They brought back epics and improve the game a lot each update. The game has new things almost each year. However in these updates things they need to bring back or change are…. CHANGE! When you don’t do a bounty you have an option to remove it . The look of the monsters (so they look cooler not more kiddish) . Right when you sign in it asks you if you are playing from home or school (It should ask at the old time (right before selecting a world) . When you get into the game it instantly pulls up wizard watch . The power bonus of the stuff in membership boxes ( they are membership items so the items should deserve to have a high 20!) Going on to…. ADD! . A special day called membership day! (basically you can buy membership only items that were in past membership boxes from Pablo the new membership day NPC!) .

I use the Practice Mode feature often, which increases the tempo automatically and builds speed and accuracy. I also use the various tones for the beat, including a voice counting tone which is great.The stage mode which switches to the next beat automatically when performing different beats in a practice is also great!Sadly, the playlist and beats do not sync across the devices which is very annoying and a let down for a cross platform app which I have paid for in the pro version. A Mac OS version would be great to build complex beats and rhythms for practice. Another feature to improve would be the subdivisions. The smallest resolution is 16 beats of 32 note lengths. It would be great to have 32 beats for 32 note lengths for intricate melody line rhythm training. Otherwise, very happy with the app!

2021-09-09 09:50:04-07:00|I really love how engaging Seesaw is for the kids and how many options they have to show their work. The ability to add voice instructions to assignments are very helpful, especially to us who work in Hawaiian language immersion. I wish Seesaw had a resource for behavior-management like ClassDojo, where they accumulate points depending on their behavior. If there was some way this platform could incorporate that, that would make this app the BEST! The “Skills” resource is extremely valuable. That is what separates Seesaw from the rest, being able to give the students quantifiable and qualitative feedback on specific standards.This Is the second time i am writing a review and I still wish that seesaw would add a behavior management resource to show the children and parents how they have been behaving. I do appreciate some of the updates made to editing and creating activities. I would appreciate if the activity didn’t change so much when I create it on my laptop to when the students work on it on their iPads. The dimensions differ I imagine and then certain text boxes move|Seesaw Class|4.0

2021-08-16 13:04:52-07:00|The extras, are not worth what they are asking. I paid it hoping to find it to be super helpful, but the price does not at all match what you get. Disappointing, especially since it is glitchy in those areas too. Before you go charging over $100 for something, you may want it working properly?Update: When you enter an activity page, and add page, you should be able to upload in each individual tab a new document. I don’t want to have to edit, and create all the content before I can even enter it into the app. It needs to be more functional. Like, upload option in each tab.|Seesaw Class|3.0
2021-08-11 08:07:07-07:00|Seesaw is a great school app in my opinion because it helps you learn a lot of stuff and it is a fantastic way for teachers to create assignments for students. And those assignments are actually fun a lot of the times. It also is a great app to store all of your hard school work you’ve done and chat with friends! I loved Seesaw in the year of 2020 and 2021 because it helped me create lots of great friendships and it helped me a lot with learning. Though I did want to be at school in person, it was certainly a great learning experience. I am looking forward to being back in person in 6th grade, but I will miss Seesaw that’s for sure. It is such a great learning and school tool that I will look forward to using it again!|Seesaw Class|5.0
2021-08-04 07:52:37-07:00|I learned a lot at Seesaw Connect and one of the things I learned was making an introduction video before the first day.

2021-07-25 21:43:01-07:00|Covid has really affected how we learn, we had already been using seesaw occasionally in class so it wasn’t a surprise that we used it for online school. I loved seesaw then and love it even more now! Teachers can send assignments to students individually, or send them to everyone. The app is easy to use and for me, using it was a price of cake. I mean I am good at technology anyways.(outsmarted my parents 43 times but who’s counting?)  No one in my class had much trouble with it and everyone loved it. Of course except the kids who hate school and did like no homework cause they were ‘busy’ but there’s always at least one of those kids in every class! Over all it’s an AMZING APP AND I RECOMMEND IT WEATHER YOU ARE DOING ONLINE OR IN PERSON SCHOOL!! Also I love you Mrs. Young and Mrs. Smith! I will miss you when I go t middle school next year! -Kara H from spring creek elementary |Seesaw Class|5.0

I also have trouble with uploading my work sometimes. I really hope a new update comes and fixes the glitches. Hoping for that soon.

2022-02-17 13:16:17-07:00|Man every tab you put in works great for me. And for an amateur guitarist at best it’s a big help. Keep up the good work|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|5.0
2022-02-17 08:52:34-07:00|Pretty sure they’re deleting reviews but here goes. Ultimate Guitar used to be the best resource for novice to expert guitar players if you were looking for chords or tabs, especially since they began forcing other free to use tab sites out. That was when they only had the website. Fast forward to today and the app is the least intuitive dumpster fire of an app I’ve ever used. What’s worse is that whether you have it downloaded or not using the site in your browser forces you to use this sorry excuse for an app in order to get at the information you want or you’ll be forced to scroll around prompts you can’t close and a site that’s basically setup to direct you to using what they want you to use. When I posted this review initially, UG commented on it to tell me I was wrong without addressing any issues I mentioned. Best off checking it out for yourself, then do yourself a favor and switch to Songsterr. It’s everything UG wishes it was. It’s so much better I gladly began paying the $5 monthly membership instead of suffering through using UG for free.|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|1.0
2022-02-16 20:18:38-07:00|Worth every. Single. Dollar. I've been playing guitar for 20 years - I love having all my favorite songs at my finger tips. I have a favorites list and pull it up at parties or gigs - it's incredible. My favorite part is being able to transpose on the spot so when a song is too low or too high I can get it in my key. It's really a game changer. Don't know what I would do without it!|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|5.0

2022-02-15 18:16:52-07:00|So I got a guitar for Christmas last year, but didn’t know anything about guitar. My brother did however and gave me a total of one lesson before he moved out, which made me annoyed.

2022-02-15 04:00:10-07:00|I doubt this review will accomplish anything but I’m going to write it anyway. I have been a guitar tabs subscriber for an upwards of five years. I payed to get rid of the ads and it was great. Today I tried to login on a different device using the same email and it wouldn’t login. I tried to reset the email from a device i already had logged in on and i ended up losing the account somehow. UGT used to be fantastic but now its just a money grab and I’m highly disappointed. Update: a tech representative reached out to me and got me logged back in. Great app! Still not a fan of the continued ads about paying to get rid of said ads.|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|4.0
2022-02-14 18:57:41-07:00|I bought this app to help with my gigs. And it use to be such an excellent app. The past Year it has been nothing but a nuisance. WHERE ARE THE DEVELOPERS. WHY IS THIS APP SO HORRIBLE NOW|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|1.0

I am aware the new lessages are above and beyond my lifetime subscription.  I am not looking to avoid paying for the lessons.  I am, however, annoyed by the frequency the ads pop up and interupt me just trying to get in and play a tab.  Thanks.|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|2.0
2022-02-14 12:10:48-07:00|I use this app, and have for years. It has helped me learn a lot about playing guitar, but lately it has only helped me know that I fiercely do not want their lessons. I already have a teacher, and I don’t want to pay for theirs. Even more than that, I want them to stop asking me. The frequent advertisements for a product they now know very well that I do not want on my “ad free” subscription is unacceptable.These course ads are showing up frequently whenever the app is opened.|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|1.0
2022-02-14 11:45:06-07:00|I purchased the app/subscription awhile back and I’m a big fan of the tab functionality, especially the pro tabs! But the CONSTANT pop ups for completely meaningless upsells are such a drag. Very disappointing that it’s such a regular part of the user experience, surely that isn’t what they had in mind?!UPDATE: Was contacted by the developer asking what an upsell is. In this case, it’s when I already have a subscription to their service for pro tabs but still receive numerous pop ups trying to sell me additional content that I couldn’t care less about. Why detract from the user experience so much just to upset customers who’ve already paid?|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|1.0
2022-02-14 11:16:37-07:00|Few days I got a problem with the payment and wrote a review about it but thankfully they just help and now is working perfectly, thank you so much it’s such a helpful app and the  administrators that help people with the issues.

2022-02-12 19:30:14-07:00|I absolutely loved this app. Used it all the time for my ukulele. Recently with the newest update though I’ve been having some troubles. Could very well be settings I need to adjust but it no longer shows chords for ukulele even when I click on the ukulele options. The chord diagrams within each song are also all in 6 string guitar format so I now have to google any chords I don’t know. While yes this is a hassle, it definitely wouldn’t make me stop using the app. However it also no longer scrolls when I’m in a song. Not just the auto-scroll feature but at all. It won’t go past the first page and a half before it cuts off. I can only see the first 6 or so lines before it cuts off and won’t scroll any further. On every song I click. Not sure what happened but it’s made this app unusable. Really sad about it and I’ll keep checking to see if it works again but for now it’s pretty much worthless for me.|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|3.0

2022-02-12 09:27:36-07:00|I’ve really enjoyed using this app, but recently an ad for the “pro” version pops up all the time (I have a pro subscription that goes until April 2022) and will not let me restore. My only option would be to subscribe again, which I’m not paying for 2 subscriptions. It then denies me access to the pro features. VERY ANNOYING!!!! I see other people are having the same issue. I’m giving 2 stars because it was useful in the past. Will likely let my subscription go because of this. My advice (at this point) would be DON’T SUBSCRIBE. There are other somewhat similar services. Again, this is a shame because this used to be an awesome service.**UPDATE** - Got an email from the developers saying they are sorry . As of today, the same issue is still there.Don’t listen to the idiots who complain about the trial or that they have to pay for a subscription. When the service worked, it was worth every penny. Why shouldn’t the developers make some money?!? The issue is that the app is broken, for that reason alone, you should avoid.

I have dozens of apps and this is the only one I have a subscription to (it’s inexpensive) - and it’s worth the world. You can play virtually any song due to the wonderful people who have written the chords or tabs for publication. Even obscure songs. It’s all there. The autoscroll and transpose features of the paid subscription are invaluable to musicians like myself.I have spend hours - no, days - no, months on this app, playing my favorite songs. This app allows people to express their musical talent in ways never done before.

I am also finding it difficult to draw on the face, but I’m sure that’s an easy fix. But other than that, this game is super amazing! I love how you can save the creation you made so you can always look at it and admire it. And go back and edit!

2021-12-31 17:44:55-07:00|Greetings developers, and happy new year! I started playing your amazing game about a week ago, and I must admit, it’s one of the most addictive games I’ve ever played. I’d highly recommend getting it! I can truly appreciate the time and love Toca Boca put into this! It’s just as fun as the priced one! Personally edit: This doesn’t, and never will take any stars off the game, but I’d like to discuss the shop. It’s an amazing opportunity to buy extra stuff! However, occasionally it would be nice if there was in game currency. I only mention this because I noticed some makeup the characters in the game wear don’t match with the style or “look” I’m going for. In game currency might allow everyone to buy slightly more natural looking makeup that you can apply for free! For instance: blush, freckles, shimmer eye liner. It’s only a suggestion, which I would appreciate if you added, but I completely understand otherwise! Thanks for the astonishing game! Again, I’d highly recommend it! |Toca Hair Salon 4|5.0
2021-12-31 14:46:36-07:00|The original idea of hair cutting was a good idea but the whole point of the 4th version is Make up and that cost money so the game is kinda a rip off. First of all the make up is way to overpriced for a virtual game it 4$ for the make up that need to lower the price or delete the game. It’s really not fun for people who wanted the game because of the make up update.because it cost money some people are not allowed to buy things on games.

2021-12-30 22:41:05-07:00|First of all, I was excited to download the app be the hair AND the makeup. But it turns out the MAKEUP was a in-app purchase! Maybe just add some shades of eyeshadow and some colors of lip sticks? And some blush. In the in-app purchase you can add some glittery shades of eyeshadow and tattoos. Also foundation is good too!(But it’s optional) You should really add more choices of clothing. Because sometimes my clothes don’t match the the haircut. You should add your customer’s feedback of how good the haircut was. Also, more choices of customers. There are very few choices of them. Now last suggestion. A spa! Now this is EXTREMELY optional, but please add a spa with a face mask, cucumbers for the eyes and some cream to heal the red stuff (I forgot what it’s called) Now, that’s it! I’d give it 5 stars if you at least add the makeup and the customer feedback.

2021-12-30 11:24:35-07:00|I literally just went to buy the candy package, because I had nothing to waste my money on, it was successful, but then it said “ something was wrong “ and it changed all of the saved things in my game then it crashed, I tried going back in but it keeps crashing my game, I deleted it and tried to download it but it refuses to download??|Toca Hair Salon 4|5.0
2021-12-29 21:40:28-07:00|WARNING If you buy this game for the makeup, you have to pay for it!!!! Everything else is amazing but just that 1 flaw.|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2021-12-29 12:42:02-07:00|This game is so fun to play, and you don’t need wifi to play it! You can do whatever you want to the hair, and challenge your family or siblings to do a certain hairstyle! It’s such a great game and very entertaining. I can play this game for hours.                                 Love,               Nani_is_the_godess_of_memes               |Toca Hair Salon 4|5.0

2021-12-27 19:53:52-07:00|I love this game. It’s adorable. The only problem I have with it is a while back I had the game and bought some of the packs. I ended up deleting it and then just today decided to download again. I’m trying to restore the purchases but when I do nothing is coming up. Please help and I’ll change my 1 star to 5. Thankyou|Toca Hair Salon 4|1.0
2021-12-27 15:57:30-07:00|It’s a good game but 1forrest1 store won’t open 2 you should be able to turn the character around to make hairstyles and more from the back too 3 it’s really hard to part hair because the brush and comb pick up to much 4 the store won’t work so it’s not like you can buy the makeup 5 it needs more clothes and tools|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2021-12-27 15:47:47-07:00|I LOVE salons, Finally found a free one too. this is my favorite so far! but a few things.. Before i say ANYTHING, It’s kinda weird that makeup is money.. Moving on though! #1.. Even though this game is realistic, i feel like when you cut the hair it looks straw, it’s way to hard to cut bangs + more. #2.. whenever i brush the hair, it’s goes nuts, LITERALLY just flys around it’s just way to sensitive for me. Overall the game is GREAT! Wish there was more creative updates!|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2021-12-20 12:16:10-07:00|I have 2 problems with this game:1. Somebody else had mentioned this to I have to pay for the make up and I want to do their make up.2.

2021-12-20 11:31:17-07:00|Toca hair salon is really fun to play. You can do the peoples hair and dress them up. There’s one problem that you can’t get your money back from playing the game. So if you can please give me back my money I would really appreciate it.|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2021-12-19 10:59:05-07:00|I love this game don’t get me wrong, buuuuuuuuuuuuut I need makeup and face paint to be free. On all your other Toca Hair Solon’s nothing had in-app purchases and I want to use all the tools cause I want the makeup and face paint so pleeeeeeeeeease make the makeup and face paint to be free pleeeeeeeeeease please, please please. But other than that the app is good you have good character updates ( cause in the first Toca Hair Solon the characters looked ehhhhh ) and maybe you should have challenges like when you chose a person how ‘bout they request the style they want for a challenge               From,    Person who made I NEED THINGS TO BE FREE!!!|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0

2021-12-12 07:12:30-07:00|So this game is REALLY FUN the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think the price for the makeup is unfair. 3 dollars and when I got the makeup I didn’t feel like there was much to offer on that.I think the makeup should be free. Please Reply!|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0

This makes almost all the kids in America whine soo much about the subscription. I hate it soo much. The developers are mean too in this game, cuz they don’t wanna respond cuz they are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo STANKIN mean. So don’t get this kiddos. Cuz it will make your parents really angry about their money. It makes me wunt to punch  this stupid app reeeaaal bad.

2020-12-01 11:19:00-07:00|I love that this app covers basics like writing numbers properly. I like that you can take a test to find out where you should start. I did not like that you can’t set up multiple users under one account. I REALLY didn’t like that it was pretty dang pricey for an app that doesn’t offer all that much. Could have been great but was lame.|Math Learner: Learning Game|2.0
2020-11-29 13:15:02-07:00|I HATE this game okay so am 8 and me and my wella were trying to find a good math game it said it was (FREE) so I agree is all but sep for one the last one IT SAID subscription 24 99$/1month oh my sorry to be rude but this game is bad,ment for rich ppl,it’s not even that good why is it so much money?

2020-10-19 13:41:09-07:00|It asks a couple simple addition questions then tells you where your level is, but you can’t do anything unless you sign up for a monthly subscription of $25/month.|Math Learner: Learning Game|1.0

2020-09-26 05:38:50-07:00|Misleading pricing to get you to click on this.  I am fine with paying for services, but please don’t dupe people into click baiting by advertising “FREE”.|Math Learner: Learning Game|4.0

2020-09-25 19:38:17-07:00|I downloaded this app because I wanted to practice for state testing. But there is a big problem. YOU CANT EVEN USE THE APP WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TRIAL, WHICH IS EXTREMELY STUPID!! It teaches like kindergarten addition and it’s not even worth the amount of money it takes to get the dumb subscription.|Math Learner: Learning Game|1.0
2020-09-24 05:01:32-07:00|I downloaded this app free to see what it was about (to see if I wanted this for my child) I never agreed to any payment yet have been being charged WEEKLY $12 for a game I’ve never touched. I never received any notification about this until now after I’ve been charged more than $100. $12 dollars a WEEK is absurd for a basic child’s game- that can only be played by 1 child- doesn’t allow you access to play all the games until you have “passed the level”.  Doesn’t allow you to have multiple account users either. This game isn’t even worth it free. I am very disappointed I was charged so much for a game my kids never even touched.  Not WORTH it AT ALL. don’t waste your time or money.  I wish I could say something different. :/|Math Learner: Learning Game|1.0
2020-09-21 14:36:27-07:00|I am in love with this app this app is so amazing try guys I gave you five stars and also I just started it and I already love it please try it . I am a cat person and a dog person  and happy Halloween |Math Learner: Learning Game|5.0
2020-09-20 10:54:14-07:00|This app doesn’t let my child play so we waited and waited and nothing happened so I deleted the game because it was awful you guys say it is bad to and you are correct you gave me Advice to delete it and I did and when I went back in a bout it did not change it still doesn’t let me in I tried for so many day and it doesn’t work I was so frustrated I deleted the game then I was calm but in my dreams I see it|Math Learner: Learning Game|2.0
2020-09-19 05:27:13-07:00|I signed up for free use of this game and I just discovered over $100 worth of charges from this game in just the last 90 days.  My daughter says she has not done anything to cause charges and sometimes it was charging $9.99 every few days!!THIS APP IS DANGEROUS DO NOT DOWNLOAD|Math Learner: Learning Game|1.0
2020-09-17 09:15:15-07:00|Developers shouldn’t work for free. Nobody should work for free.

2020-09-11 19:44:57-07:00|I am sick and tired of installing apps that appear to be free but are NOT. This is as much the fault of Apple as it is these clowns. Totally unethical!  If an app costs money to use it indicate that upfront!  Do you hear me Apple?!|Math Learner: Learning Game|1.0
2020-09-08 09:06:44-07:00|This is all a trick to get money. Do not download this app. They let you play one game then the try to get you pr money. Now they don’t allow you to send the review because any nickname you submit, is taken.|Math Learner: Learning Game|5.0
2020-08-25 22:11:25-07:00|My daughter downloaded this app says free she never even used it and for some odd reason I’m constantly getting charged and I never noticed until today!!!

2020-08-12 05:13:52-07:00|$24.99 a month? No thanks. Only the placement activity is free. And their division makes no sense. If you don’t put the work in exactly how they want, even if your answer is right, it marks it wrong. I did the test myself and that was frustrating, then come to find out it is an insane monthly cost. Plenty of other good math games for less.|Math Learner: Learning Game|2.0

2020-07-27 07:27:29-07:00|$25 a month? Laughable. Says it’s free then doesn’t let you do anything unless you pay $25 A MONTH. garbage of an app. do not recommend.|Math Learner: Learning Game|1.0
2020-07-24 20:54:54-07:00|Since we are in quarantine, my mom and I have Ben looking for games.Then I found this game. I went on, and it said I needed to PAY to play it. Like I am not playing 25$ to do just lessons! Once I get updated, maybe I will make it higher.|Math Learner: Learning Game|1.0
2020-07-17 16:33:19-07:00|So ya I downloaded the game and answered everything correctly then it put me on the 1+ to 10+ and I already knew everything then I decided to delete it to take the test again then the numbers got all messed up and it put me on the 1+ to 10+ again so ya I would rather do another game that I’m too good at then a game that doesn’t know what I’m typing,but after all that it’s not a bad game|Math Learner: Learning Game|3.0
2020-07-15 07:59:17-07:00|I’ve never really been good at math, and I was hoping I could use this app to get me a head start in the school year.

2015-07-22 16:45:43-07:00|This was my favorite app for my 18 month old who likes to make pictures. This last update added an ad banner at the bottom where all the crayons and color choices are.

2022-01-30 20:47:21-07:00|Hello. I have been playing pbskids games since I was little and while going back to them for nostalgia, i noticed none of the old games I played were there(such as Mix and Paint, the Curious George sandcastle game, the Martha Speaks games, and many more). So I suggest that you bring back the old games the newer generations. If you need a list of the old games I will happily give it to you. Please consider this, as they were very well done games which were not only a great deal of my childhood, but also very informative. Have a nice day. - a nostalgic player|PBS KIDS Games|3.0

This has caused my autistic son to be very upset.  I was able to get the app on a fire stick tv and it works as expected there.  We have deleted and reinstalled on different Apple TV and ipad but no fix.  Any advice you can give to me?|PBS KIDS Games|2.0

2021-11-27 08:10:14-07:00|So, I had this game on my IPad but it never really worked so I got it on my IPhone. It was great at first but then it started freezing up as I was playing and the screen would turn from pink to white to black and then it would go back to the page where you click start after clicking on a game. This one game called Cooking School from Ready Jet Go! Is constantly freezing and it will only let me make the first thing! After I make it, it always says “Here is someone biiiig book of recipes. Let’s make this first!” But thing it tells me to make is the thing I just made!!!|PBS KIDS Games|3.0

I tried expanding the storage limit and deleting old games, but now only a select few downloaded and many are sitting with the grey circle.  I cant cancel the downloads and none seem to be activity downloading.  Personally I would like more control over what games are stored.

2021-09-30 16:23:13-07:00|Updated:  **This app could be absolutely amazing and beneficial for kids if it worked! It is constantly freezing, crashing, the sound is constantly missing.Between uninstalling and reinstalling it, restarting the iPad, we have yet to find a solution. I reached out to the developer in the past with no reply. Please solve these issues! My son has been using this app since the summer and recently navigated away from the usual games the app offers. He was excited to try something new however the games just show the loading circle icon and does nothing. Between this and the sound coming and going It’s incredibly frustrating especially for a special needs child who lacks control over emotions.|PBS KIDS Games|1.0

2022-01-09 12:13:21-07:00|Being completely honest here, I really wish this app was good then I would genuinely not be incredibly frustrated using this app. Most of the 5 star reviews are about the students “not wanting to learn” even though they are kinda forced to. The app is incredibly buggy (and I mean that) sometimes the video restarts for mo apparent reason and we can’t even fast forward to the part we were previously watching. Also it’s incredibly hard to answer questions due to the issue where if we didn’t get a answer for a question and try to “rewatch to find answer” it only gives us a split second to watch he video then proceeds to bombard us with the question. Absolutely and I truest mean this with a burning passion do not get this app just use the website on a computer because this is a waste of space and a waste of my time.|Edpuzzle|1.0

Absolutely nothing was left.When you first log into the game, you’re hit with a “SUBSCRIBE” poster, even if you have the subscription.Then you’re given a ton of offers to purchase this or that, or whatever else.Now you don’t need to buy these to have fun in the game. It’s a fine game by itself.But I figured I would drop around $15 on the game, since I had gotten about 20 or so hours out of it.When I log in, all I see is all the things I had bought GONE. Lost hours worth of progress.Emailed them with no response. I just refunded my items and will be deleting the app.What happened to free rewards?

2021-09-07 20:39:19-07:00|I actually really love this game I have been a long time user and I love the frequent events that happen however $60 is ALOT to pay for a tap fish game subscription for a app subscription period only to find that there really wasn’t any benefits other then 30 pearls a day and a puffin that gives me random things and I COULD NOT BELIEVE that with buying the $60 year subscription I still have to make a separate in app purchase($10) for a  Premium pass to access certain events items. But the biggest disappointment in this game is how greedy the app makers were with the prices for buying extra items in game I find myself think I would do and purchase more with this game if the prices weren’t so outrageous.

2021-08-02 23:08:00-07:00|I would rate this game 5 star if there weren’t one big thing I really didn’t like about this game. I think theres too many events happening. Sure, events are fun, i like collecting all the new fish and extensions and of course the hermit crabs. However, putting events back to back against one another with no time in between to play the game normally and level up my non event fish and coral shows that the timing at least in between the events are too short. Lately, I've been ignoring the events happening that don’t include the anniversary, Halloween, or Christmas events so i can just play the game as it was intended. I hope you take my advice when i say there should be around a week between each event so everyone can play normally.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|4.0
2021-08-01 07:25:34-07:00|I love this game it is very addictive. And sometimes things are a little buggy. Right now it is not opening the ads so I can’t get my free stuff.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|4.0
2021-07-30 18:22:36-07:00|I used to have this game a few years ago I believe- I forgot but I had it on my tablet, it was super fun ! but I had VERY little patience and gave up 3 days later because the process of collecting fish was “slow”. I honestly regret uninstalling it because it was so zen and so entertaining and it would teach me the value of hard work . I recommend this to children and adults, children: To teach them the value of hard work and that nothing worth having comes easy, Older People: As a zen game and a stress reliever  Anyways if you don't have anger issues, and you have a decent amount of patience, DOWNLOAD NOW Requirements: -A Lot of Device Storage 95% of people don't have-Patience-Being able to help a cute statue thing find friends voluntarily-To give this game a five star review because this game deserves it! OK!Thats all Thank you |Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0
2021-07-26 01:12:33-07:00|Been playing for so long for years now but just got back into it and have been playing for a couple weeks now and noticed that the events are essentially pay to win at this point. Haven't noticed the crashes and bugs or glitches everyone else has experienced but would love to be able to earn these cool and unique fish without having to spend 20$ just to get a new dolphin or turtle. Wouldn't mind having to work towards a new fish that takes awhile but would be worth it but for the event i literally cannot complete a row in bingo without having to purchase something in the shop with real $. Very disappointed but still love the game and its relaxation. Would love to see the game go back to how it was where we could you could take time on events and get everything that was worth getting.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|3.0
2021-07-24 12:22:02-07:00|I used to play but deleted the game. I redownloaded it today hoping for a fresh start. Normally games will have a pop-up asking if you want to restore progress. This one had the pop-up but there wasn’t a “no” option. :(|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|3.0

2021-07-19 21:26:38-07:00|Watching ads in this game is a good way to get extra hearts (currency in this game).  Rather, it would be a good way except that half the time when you waste your time watching the ad, you don’t get the reward promised.It’s very frustrating especially when it’s supposed to double your idle/away income.  Sometimes it will even freeze and need to be restarted..at which time-you guessed it!  The reward is lost.If not for this, I would play it and enjoy it a lot more.  This is the only game I’ve played recently that does this and it’s beyond annoying.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|2.0

2021-06-20 15:01:35-07:00|It feels infuriatingly impossible to get the narwhal. I have tried time and time again to get him, yet after so many attempts I still have not yet gotten him. I think that having to tap the top left corner a thousand times to get one fish is okay since it’s doable, but it is not doable for the narwhal since you need to tap 5,000 to get this one animal. All it does is get you frustrated because of the waste of time tapping that long as well as cause pain to your fingers. I don’t think that tapping 5000 times is worth it at all. I love everything else about this game, but this issue that hasn’t gone away after so many attempts has really made me extremely frustrated. Also I was supposed to get the leatherback turtle since I unlocked another animal after tapping on mystery chest 100 times.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|3.0
2021-06-17 16:50:12-07:00|I love this game so much! Thank you for making it. It is so so amazing and better than the old version! I love that it is not just fish, whales, sharks, and other stuff but you added dogs and cats which is one of my main reasons that this game is so worth it. Thanks for reading my Review and creators please make more cute cool and adorable updates to this game! Rate this game 5 stars.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0
2021-06-16 07:12:50-07:00|My only major gripe about this game is that it can be kinda slow when trying to get new fish but, otherwise it’s extremely relaxing and everyone can enjoy it|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0

2017-05-01 15:52:17-07:00|This app is amazing, it has more options and problem solvers than anything else I've seen and is truly the best! I've had it for months and am still learning about just how much it can do! Also if you go to the function button and scroll to the bottom it sometimes says funny things and jokes which is great because who doesn't need a smile here and there while doing math? Any ways it's great, i recommend it for sure, and it's free so there's nothing to lose!|EduCalc Classic|5.0

Also why would you want to pay dollars a month just for  kids to learn? I except it is making me mad also it affects my feelings. And I know I IXL  teach you how to do it when it doesn’t give you a proper information how to do it. Also kids don’t want to learn from IXL because education is just not from doing it it also includes some fun in it. And an is your way to do it is just teacher kids.

2022-02-13 14:22:07-07:00|Seriously, IXL is a horrible way to “teach” kids. It’s just lazy teachers that are out of things to do. It is extremely stressful to use and 9 times out of 10 I end up either giving up or in tears, or both. WHY DO YOU LOSE MORE THAN YOU GAIN!!!!! It is so demotivating seeing all of work gone because I got a single question wrong.|IXL - Math, English, & More|1.0

2022-02-11 07:37:25-07:00|I used this app since I was in 3rd grade it was hard but I got through it I did increase my anger and I had to go to therapy then I used it for online school due to Covid-19 but it was alright at first but then it got harder and harder I once was at 78 and I reversed me to 54 that’s messed up then I saw that is a profit organization which is just wrong so then I learned it has sooo many complains it sooo glitchy once I put the answer and it said it was incorrect yet I told me the correct answer was the one I put it is SOO glitchy when I switch apps it just freezes and won’t let me type then WORST THING OF ALL YOU HAVE TO PAY LIKE ARE YOU FOR REAL.

2022-02-11 07:17:26-07:00|I hate how this app takes away more points than I even get when I’m so close to finishing it. This app literally is making students mad instead of teaching them. It is good that they explain why you’re wrong at the bottom but you really think anyones gonna read it?|IXL - Math, English, & More|1.0

2022-02-10 18:04:05-07:00|As the title says, this app is absolutely terrible! I a student have to use this for over an hour just in SCHOOL. I have to use this every time I finish work and if I don’t get an 80 or above then I will get basically an F. I don’t ever get a break I always have to do a IXL in my free time, it’s not encouraging at all and doesn’t make me want to learn either. I have 1:30 minutes on average in IXL in just my free time on a regular school day!! And I’m not joking when a kid literally had 150+ answered and still hadn’t gotten a 100. It also takes you down from a 90 to A 70 or 65! And in all isn’t encouraging! Sure it says “good job” when you get one right after writing down 12345678910 equations. Me my friend and everyone in my class hates it. We are even signing a petition to get rid of it, but we need about 18,000 people to sign to not make it mandatory in our state. That’s how much we hate it. I have learnt more from tiktok then I have from IXL. And I’ve used this app since kindergarten, I’ve hated it back then and I still hate it now. Do not get it! Do something more educational and better in general. I do not recommend using this in your classroom or assigning things in IXL either. It has made numbers kids literally cry! And is  one of the NUMBER ONE stress makers in my class, OVER TESTS. that’s how horrible it is please don’t get it we all hate it.!|IXL - Math, English, & More|1.0
2022-02-10 16:57:25-07:00|So i was really high on the smart score got one wrong. and went down 7!!! And then I got one right and went up 3 how does that logic work|IXL - Math, English, & More|1.0

2022-02-10 11:20:41-07:00|So this app is so stressful and horribly designed, I asked my whole Math Period and everyone agrees this app causes nothing more than pain and staying up for hours to finish these things and even sometimes we don't even finish them. This is the kind of app made by someone who wants nothing more than children and teens to suffer the amount of tears and mental/ emotional damage. The damage this app causes is honestly Impressive.So lets get into the reason behind why I call this app a waste of time and space,The point system is Horrible you get to a 80 one miss click leads to 75 and then it goes into a spiral and then your at 45 and the little explanations the app tries to give you to “explain how you got it wrong” never helps. This all leads to what I like to call “the 3 steps of IXL.” Step 1 Frustration the student starts getting slightly frustrated with the work but they keep working.Step 2 denial they start to believe they have the right answer even if its completely wrong and they start disagreeing with the app if it says their wrong.Step 3 infuriation This step is when tears and broken computers come into play, after all that effort, all that time the student has reached a High score and is almost done and then it all comes crashing down the student does 1 of 3 things they start going into a frenzy of rage and start rapidly answering questions mostly guessing which leads them to giving up and closing their computers, or they give up right away crying about it before closing their computer,and finally they go into a real fit of rage and destroy their device.|IXL - Math, English, & More|1.0
2022-02-10 10:46:52-07:00|To tbh I don’t wanna brag but your game is horrible like bad cheese like don’t teach kids that they can do magic it’s like saying kids can curse what you gonna do throw me in ye stocks and this game is so glitchy we’re wasting our time with boredom when we can be out there doing real school it kicked me out of my account bc of your game I wasted money for nothing huge scam wouldn’t recommend until they know how to make a real school|IXL - Math, English, & More|1.0

2022-01-18 09:36:26-07:00|Updated Review:  I’ve been a long time player of 7 Little Words, purchased many packs and endured a number of redesigns.  A recent one, unfortunately eliminated the unlimited hints option for many of us.  After two days of email discussion with the developers, they found a bug in the program, which they addressed in the most recent update.  The folks I dealt with were helpful, professional and addressed my concerns in a timely and courteous manner.  Other companies could learn from the BlueOx team.  Well done!*****Original Review:  Not only have the developers put out a simply terrible update, but they have removed the unlimited hints option that I PURCHASED years ago. It’s like paying for a car in cash and having the dealership come to you 10 years later and say you no longer have access to the steering wheel unless you fork up more money. So disappointing!|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|5.0

I bought a bunch of puzzle packs, I believe I paid for ad free when that became an issue and I also bought the unlimited hints when I began buying puzzle packs. Now I find out I have to buy MORE hints?! Worse, I can only buy so many as there are no more unlimited! What about those of us who already paid for the privilege of having these features?! Now you want to milk us out of more money for things we already paid for?! Sorry, your game isn’t worth it. As far as I’m concerned, I’ll be playing something else from now on. It’s a shame, this game really was helping my anxiety, too…|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|2.0
2022-01-13 13:52:13-07:00|Been playing for years and paid for unlimited hints. Noticed today I only have 5. I tried restoring previous purchases and it didn’t work. Otherwise, I’m pleased with the changes.|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|3.0
2022-01-13 11:47:51-07:00|The developer replied to my review to let me know that they have made a change in the letter grouping at the bottom for iPads. The letter groupings are larger & easier to read. Looks like the made the font in the clues is a bit smaller. Developers - Thank you for listening to the reviews! The new format is hard to read.The delete / backspace button is hard to see. The new “extras” whatever they are… not necessary. The format directly before this was easy to see, and read. All buttons were accessible. The letter groups are way too small, and crammed together, because you made the clues “bigger?” There is too much space between the clues - shorten that up, give more room for the letter groups. If you insist on the extra whatever’s, put them at the bottom, out of the way, in the OLD format.|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|4.0

2022-01-13 08:13:14-07:00|I love the new options for ‘hints’ and the overall feel of the app with the update. My only complaint is I seem to have lost my unlimited ‘hints’ that I obtained over 2 years ago.

2022-01-13 08:00:06-07:00|I liked this game and a few years ago I had the option to get free unlimited hints.  I only used them when I was really stuck and usually just one hint would be all I needed. Now with the new version you took that away from me.|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|3.0
2022-01-13 00:58:10-07:00|I have loved this game for a long time, but after the facelift, it crashes as it tries to load the ads between games. Very irritating to have to restart after every puzzle.|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|4.0
2022-01-12 19:45:38-07:00|When the new update first rolled out, I still had my unlimited hints I’d purchased a few years ago. Today, they’re gone.

2022-01-12 17:47:40-07:00|Update:   Thank you for responding about the update.  It is much better and I can see it!!I've played your game for years and love it,however the updates are maddening. Every time it’s updated, it gets worse, from word size, layout and speed. It never improves! I hate to admit it, bit I'm elderly and the new layout for word choices, at the bottom, is small and too close together. Please hurry with a new update or even go back to the way it was two or three updates ago.|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|4.0
2022-01-12 15:13:11-07:00|Have enjoyed this app for years. Even paid to have ads removed. But the new 2022 format has made this game visually difficult. The letter boxes are too small and severely impaired by heavy rectangular borders. It now has the look of a novice programmer…ugh! My eyes can’t take the new format. Offer an option for the old format by next week, or lose a multi-year subscriber.|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|1.0
2022-01-12 15:03:13-07:00|I loved this game until this update. It was perfect so I fail to see the reasoning to change it. Since you’ve added to the screen the letters got smaller and jammed together. New screen is hard to play. I’ll keep playing for a while but probably not for long. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.This was the review I sent in January 2020. I got a notification from  developer that I got a response. The new problem is there are hundreds of reviews with no rhyme or reason as to the dates of reviews. They jump all over the place so I couldn’t find my review.|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|3.0

2022-01-10 21:37:08-07:00|I love this game & play it every evening. However, I really don’t like the new format. I like that you brought back the feature where the clues can be enlarged, as well as all the help features, but the answers are crowded or cluttered & I find it somewhat disconcerting. I often tap the wrong clue by accident. Aside from that, I do enjoy this game.|7 Little Words: Word Puzzles|4.0

There's no stopping it and it interferes with every single activity! Was going to purchase app but thought I'd try it first and now I'm not sure that this issue would go away even if I purchased the app and at this point I'm frustrated and not going to go through with purchase.

2016-12-12 11:05:25-07:00|So in fairness most of the kids games are ok. Very cheap content for what the heck you pay for this entire app. So that is pretty ridiculous! Also don't you think a toddler app would allow you to lock the kid into the app and not allow them access to rest of your phone while they use the app?! I think that is under the duh factor!! Beyond that sons of the games like the car race game is so ridiculously dumb I am mad that I bought this app. The animal noise are a two second snip of a sound byte that sound like crap.  Way to sell the cheapest thing you could put together and then charge $7.99 for the darn thing!|Phone for Play - Creative Fun|1.0
2016-12-08 18:50:59-07:00|"I'd give this app a much higher rating for overall content, however there are annoying ads on pretty much every single page even AFTER I paid for the app. That's just plain DECEPTION!!! My toddler keeps hitting the ad either by mistake (his wrist or hand touches the ad surface as he is trying to play with the app) or because his attention is drawn to the ad. In either case, he ""navigates"" away from the app to the other content, which annoys him as much as his parents, especially when it happens every 15 seconds.

2021-05-31 13:28:56-07:00|I love this app, it’s so great because it teaches 4-10 year olds about god and what he did for us to have this life we have right now.

My only complaint is that they got rid of the trumpet-like sounds that the characters used to make when they danced or ”talked”. It used to make us laugh. We miss it!

Though I still want to know all the story’s in the Bible. Then I found this app! It is teaching me all about God and Jesus. Also I know it is changing me whenever I think about goodness that God and Jesus have done.

I’ve also used it in primary classes for all ages with lots of success. I will say that LDS moms may want to view the section on Adam and Eve and the final chapter on the overview of the gospel message and discuss with their kids if the interpretation is not exactly in line with how you want it presented to your kids, but this is my favorite religious app for kids, hands down, and I can’t recommend it enough|Bible App for Kids|5.0

2021-03-19 05:41:22-07:00|This app overall is nice, but I agree with another reviewer regarding the story of Abraham and Isaac. I just began using this app with my 5 year old and this lesson was only the third story he chose to watch. After having just told me, “This teaches good stuff” he heard the narrator say that Abraham was going to kill his son, and he looked at me in horror. I understand some truths in the Bible are unpleasant. Being an app for children I find this depiction (including images of Abraham holding a knife and Isaac lying on an alter tied up) to be inappropriate and frightening. I use the adult version of this app and thought this would be a safe and fun way to introduce my son to bible lessons, but now I’m afraid to let him watch more.|Bible App for Kids|2.0

2022-02-24 20:19:29-07:00|ok so i played animal jam for many years of my childhood and spent tons of money on it, i went on the other day for some nostalgia and its deleted but when i look it up from my new acc it still exists? give it back thats literally such a scam|Animal Jam|1.0
2022-02-24 20:09:51-07:00|Hello ajhq, today in this evening, I’ve been told my session to play animal jam has expired. I already logged in yesterday  and now I have to put my password in again, when I already put my password yesterday. Please fix this issue, thank you,|Animal Jam|2.0
2022-02-24 17:58:53-07:00|Ok, animal jam is great but OMG!!! My best friend literally scammed me blackout stylish glasses she promised me that she would work for another pair of double tails if I give her the glasses, I worked so hard for those glasses 4 or 3 years of hard work. Please ban komawolf27 and if you can. Go on her account please and take the glasses off and return them to me. This is really unfair..|Animal Jam|2.0
2022-02-24 17:48:54-07:00|This game is REALLY FUN! I rate it 5/5 BUT there should be more ways to earn sapphires for nonmembers. They kind of have nothing but drops when done games. I went to a drop and saved up for member. MEMBER IS AMAZING! But about those who can't afford to spend money on a game? Or don't have enough sapphires? Their missing a couple of amazing things. Yes yes I know there as to be stuff to make membership special but there should also be more stuff for nonmembers such as more gem animals. There should also be more gem dens. It would also be cool to have special areas for water animals- like in aj classic. I like that aj has packs for everyone in one of the newer updates. Aj is finally becoming more fair  keep up the good work ajhq Overall animal jam play wild- (or wait it's just aj now) is a AMAZING GAME! I definitely recommend it 100%. It really helps me meet new friends, and stay connected to friends from school! Thank you thank you for making this game pawsome!! UPDATE: yayyyyyy AJ FINALLY LET NONMEMBERS GET SHOPS! Now nonmembers can get sapphires by selling unwanted!!!! THANK YOU AJ!Lowered my rating of wildworks due to Fer.al being shut down. Sorry.|Animal Jam|3.0
2022-02-24 17:48:35-07:00|Honestly, animal jam has gotten better. I love that they added shops and pet stations available for non members! I love the animals decorating your animal! I think the shops are super easy to get money out of! Although, please animal jam! Add red pandas and Arctic foxes again! Trust me. There super cute and they would be popular! I really also love that there is some educational features in this app. I’m happy that there is so many updates and so many things you get to do in ajpw! Some bugs here and there but over all this is so fun! I love playing role plays and hanging out with friends. I have been bullied on this game before, but I do trust the safe chats. Jammers are a lot safer these days. This is definitely worth it even without the membership! You can do so much! You won’t regret it! That’s my review!|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-24 17:37:00-07:00|Why.. do you have to close fer.al down tell me please I want to know and open it back up please tell me… rip fer.al .. and I don’t want to get your app anymore sorry … you nvm… please tell me I’m not going to be mad or anything…. Please open it back up I had fun playing it |Animal Jam|1.0
2022-02-24 17:13:41-07:00|Animal jam is amazing! OMG everyone is so nice and kind! All of the mini games are fun and so creative and so are the animals!!! I would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone! It’s very relaxing andaesthetically  pleasing to play!! The only suggestion I would have is to disable the non chat trading feature is just awkward but animal jam is amazing best game I’ve played by FAR!!!!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-24 15:32:56-07:00|Hello! I would just like to say I love this game. I have just been having some trouble creating a new account. You see I wanted to make an back up account but it hasn’t been working. I get through making the username and password but when I put my email and push the go button. It says error. It says to restart Animal Jam and I’ve done all of that. I’ve turned off my iPad. Reloaded AJ and more! And every time it says that no matter what I try. Please help me and tell me what I could do! If it’s not me then it would be greatly appreciated for this bug to be fixed soon. Thanks for the game and have a great day!|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-24 14:08:25-07:00|Today I was playing and it said your session has expired please put in your password so I did and it said I was Suspended? I have never said a bad word or anything but the game was going so good! Befor all this happened I just got a Arctic Wolf and everything was great! My user name is Yahna11 pls let me play again!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-24 10:54:34-07:00|It’s so fun1!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-24 10:39:00-07:00|I love this game, so much has changed about it in a good way! Lots of new and fun things to do, I have been playing this game for a few years now and it never gets boring! There’s so much to do with constant updates!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-24 10:26:11-07:00|The problem in my other review has been fixed, but it has happend 3 times more. I think it’s just to review your password to make sure no one else is on your accont, ( nice feature! ) I think I couldn’t remember my password at the time, again it has happend 3 more times. And only one of those times has been where I could not get in. I made a new password put it in, and it worked like a charm! Amazing game by the way! It’s so fun and so creative! I love you wildworks  Love, Fluttershy1856!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-24 08:04:26-07:00|Why do they have to be so expensive? |Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-24 07:18:53-07:00|So I like how you take away animals for new ones but me and my friend really want different types of animals that are out of the store. Can you put more animals in on different season? I would really like that!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-24 06:15:46-07:00|You can spend hours on this game. But it also teaches younger kids about creatures, forest, and a little math. The chat might be a little sensitive only so you can’t be mean to anyone. I love the trading, styling your animal, shopping, and decorating your very own den. LIKE WHAT- they put so much time into this game it’s unreal. BUT MOST OF ALL YOU LEARN THE KEYBOARD! Plz check out my YouTube channel: Cleo8904! Thx for reading!!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-23 19:36:19-07:00|Great game and great at giving feedback when help is needed!!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-23 18:51:23-07:00|So first is that I don’t like you have to play games to get sapphires and also why are animals and music and dens so expensive?! I wish you could trade animals or get sapphires from pack runs and type what you wanna say when your a guest jammer (which I know guest jammer accounts are for testing to see if they like the game but what if they don’t have or know their parents email? Just a thought)  or not hv to be a member to do stuff like create packs and get certain things.Like I hv been saving up for a fennec fox for at least a year now and it left!!  I just wish things weren’t SO expensive like member and animals and yeah so pls fix the problems though TYSM creators for making this game I love it and have a great day! Edit- Pls add back Arctic foxes:) Also, I found 2 (not bugs) but stuff I dislike. One: sometimes when I’m playing THERES this really deep beeping noise? Like what??? Second: whenever my friends leave like 30 seconds ago it says like 6 or 7 hours ago?? Like what?? Also the animal options aren’t great right now. Please add more soon! (Idea of another animal is maybe a dragon or a parrot!!) Other than that no bugs. But I do have one more complaint, why would you take down Fera.l? I loved that game so much!!! Pls bring it back. Overall, this game is amazinggggggg! Totally recommend! Have fun and stay wild! -Empororfox36|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-23 17:19:23-07:00|Hi! First off I love Animal Jam, but it’s a bit too addictive. Now into talking to my buds lol. Hi buds! I’m so sorry that I quit, but it’s too negative and addictive. I miss all of my buds :c I may get the game when I’m older or something, and I hope you all have a great day, night, or morning. I miss all of you, buds. My new acc, when I’m older will be called…… “Sasquatchqueen217” I will remember you’re users buds! So if in the future you get a trade or bud request from, “Sasquatchqueen217”, It’s me ~Sasquatchqueen|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-23 16:56:17-07:00|I LOVE Animal Jam but here’s the thing… When I tried to play it, it’s said, “ Your session has expired. Re-enter password to log-in. “ Why!? I loved playing that game! Now I am trying to figure out what my password is… I liked animal jam but Why would you do this to me? I’m so sad and so angry because I can’t play it anymore. |Animal Jam|2.0
2022-02-23 15:26:49-07:00|So, this game is RELLY fun but there's a lot of people who HACK.     You also might get scammed a lot, but here's some tips to not get scammed: never accept weird trades, never say yes when somebody says, gift me that and I will gift you this or something like that, but aside from that it's really fun. There’s no adds so yeah.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-23 09:49:27-07:00|So, animal jam is great, but one day I logged on, and guess what? My main account is glitched! Im so upset!|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-22 23:14:15-07:00|WHY! WHY DID U SHUT DOWN FER.AL! You all are a peace of junk! Everyone loved that game! People who are reading, DO NOT by wild works games! Cause once you’ve grown to love it! IT GETS SHUT DOWN! DO NOT BY THIS OR ANY OTHER GAME MADE BY THEM! If you want an animal game buy wildcraft!|Animal Jam|1.0
2022-02-22 21:14:41-07:00|I played animal jam and it’s a good game and I would recommend it if wild works weren’t bad. Wild works threw away a great community and game, it’s two year old game Fer.al Fer.al was basically a tester for their NFT game Cinder. And NFT’s are just horrible, and I believe they used crypto to make it. You just lost a supporter, I’m not getting any of your new or old games and deleting all of your games I have, because I don’t want to support someone who uses NFT. I hope some more of you will do the same, but I’m glad some more people will know what’s happening and how bad NFT’s are.|Animal Jam|2.0
2022-02-22 16:09:39-07:00|I love animal jam it’s so unique unlike any of my other games everyone’s so nice and the online part is amazing I like how you can customize your character and have pets you can also play mini games all of my friends play this now because of me I love this game. But I would like to ask if you can lower the prices on the animals and if you would open up the shops to everyone if you can than thank you|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-22 14:26:49-07:00|Ik this aint related but WHY U SHUT DOWN FERAL UNSHUT IT PLSSSSS PLS|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-22 13:20:07-07:00|This game is amazing but I have some suggestions to make it even better. I think that a leader of a pack should have a little more power I also think that you shouldn’t need to be a member to be a leader but guest jammers should not be able to be a leader. And I think pack hideouts should be customizable (only the owner of the pack could customize the pack hideout) but it could only be customized with items that have the theme of the pack. And there would be a pack den item shop in every pack but only the owner could buy stuff from it. And pack members could send a request to the owner of what they want in the pack hideout.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-22 13:11:11-07:00|I love this game, it just gets boring over time|Animal Jam|3.0
2022-02-22 12:04:41-07:00|Please make the drawing tool better! The limitations are so frustrating. It needs more options, like more brush sizes, more brushes like Animal Jam Classic, layers, and an option to undo/redo more than once! It’s so frustrating only being able to undo once, and I often rage quit.|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-22 04:22:00-07:00|Okay, so, I know that some people are mad that they don’t have membership and want it because they can’t get sapphires. Well now non members can have a shop and a pack! Yay. Also, the animals that are going away are put on sale! Sadly, pets aren’t though. Some people are also mad that they can’t get a sugar glider cus no one will trade with them and even if they did, they wouldn’t be able to trade a fair trade because they aren’t rare and even if they do have a lot of sapphires, the OTHER person doesn’t have a shop! So now you’re crying and beg your parents for membership just so you can look rare and get daily sapphires. NOW your parents aren’t happy that you wasted their time, they don’t wanna buy you membership. So you continue to play the game and when your older, YOU (try to) buy membership, BUT it doesn’t work because your internet is messing things up! Now animal jam says, “ Please connect your devise to the internet to continue” now you throw your phone across the room. You check it, it’s got a giant crack in it. Now you try to fix it, ya can’t. You cry. This is why we need sugar gliders back in the game!Okay so that was my speech babye|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-21 18:34:44-07:00|Ok first of all people randomly get logged out and loose all there stuff like WHAT THe HECK I get so MAD because I was soooo rich in my account then just randomly lost it dUDE that’s suffering for people sometimes that are addicted to there phones iPads and. Computers because I am not complaining I am just sad that people randomly loose there account I lost FOR real two accounts like BRUHhHHH why though its just AGH just a warning that if u get this game u can hv fun in all its a good game but u can loose accounts bc of stupid bugs and glitches, I am just saying- I was not lucky- AT all-|Animal Jam|3.0
2022-02-21 15:28:47-07:00|Animal jam is a awesome game it is a great animal simulator and also you can do role plays, trade, and buy animals! It is great! But the problem is that you need sapphires to buy animals it’s fine but sapphires are a little hard to get but there is one way to get a lot of sapphires you can get a member ship but also this game is actually very educational for kids and parents so if you made animal jam please make a labradoodle for a owner and pet but also please make sapphires easier to get You are doing great with animal jam!|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-21 14:48:27-07:00|I onastly want all animals and things to come. Back next up date plus new one I got some ideas animal gliders huge dens pink double tail no scammers|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-21 14:25:14-07:00|I enjoy the game but I want y’all to stop adding cats and dogs. I think y’all should add the mammoth and the beaver and the platypus and even DINOSAURS |Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-21 11:52:18-07:00|I am very irritated with this game I logged into it today to see that ALL MY 1069 SAPPHIRES ARE GONE MOST OF MY RATE AND HARD TO OBTAIN CLOTHING ITEMS DISAPPEARED LIKE WTH I’m not happy in the slightest|Animal Jam|2.0
2022-02-21 11:34:49-07:00|Hi I really no I send a lot off these but I really wish we can have a pet unicorn!it would be so cool !also if u don’t like animal jam u will probably be the weirdest person in the world !who dose not like animal jam?anyway can we stop the glitches!!!!!!!!eveytime I at a fashion show pa pow glitch!do u no how to stop glitches!also this is confusing at a my shop a pet is 999,999 gems and I have 180 gems and it says I have enough!

2022-02-21 10:08:05-07:00|I just bought a new sea den and I think there should be sea creatures in the game|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-21 09:33:48-07:00|I have been play jape for several years and it is my favorite game.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-21 09:30:32-07:00|Seriously wildworks? Why shut down Fer.al ? It was a great game, the different world were amazing to explore and the magic quests were fun. I only had the game for a little while but I fell in love! It’s sort of a more mature animal jam. And yet you just shut it down? WHY?! You said it’s becuase of business problems but I feel like Fer.al should stay active! VERY angry wildworks! |Animal Jam|1.0
2022-02-21 05:44:18-07:00|I’ve been trying to get this game my whole life it’s due it’s still done to restrictions please open it back up I really wanna play everything is on restrictions these days please I know it’ll be a great game that’s why I gave it a five star but no one ever lets me play it|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-21 04:28:09-07:00|THIS GAME IS AWESOME BUT THAT ISNT WHY IM WRITING THIS!  I TRIED TO FIND FER.AL, BUT I CANT FIND IT. WHY ARE YU SHUTTING FERAL DOWN!? I HAVE LOST SO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOUR COMPANY. JUST THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE PLAYERS WHO HAVE BEEN PLAYING SINCE THE GAME CAME OUT! THIS IS SO UNFAIR. AGAIN, I HAVE LOST SO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOUR COMPANY!! I hope you understand my complaints, you say the game was unsuccessful but it wasn’t!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-20 18:11:40-07:00|So I absolutely love animal jam I hav been playing for YEARS!! But one thing that would help a lot, is a trading record. I got hacked a few days ago and they stole all my rare pets and items and it would be very nice, if I could see who traded my account stiff onto theirs. Like in a few other games they have a trade record (like in adopt me). It would be nice for younger kids if you went through a test about trading like in adopt me. So they know. (Everytime I'd play animal jam as a kid I would forget about al the bad people) there are very few people who are rude on animal jam. So it is very safe and a very good learning game for kids. I love animal jam and it will always be one of the best parts of my childhood. Thank you for making such a kid friendly game that millions play every day.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-20 16:42:33-07:00|I was was reported because they assumed I was a scammer but all I said was “I’m giving away all of sir Gilbert’s armour including chipmunk pet for double tsunami wings” so the person didn’t have any and said scammer and reported me! My emotion was furious |Animal Jam|2.0
2022-02-20 11:00:37-07:00|This game is so cool I love to play it.Me and my school friend love to play.After school we play and call each other and play it’s amazing.She is my best buddy on there this game definitely gets a five star rating.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-20 09:33:25-07:00|Ok I love animal jam so much it’s so fun.animal jam allows u to communicate with everyone else. I love trading and shopping. I do want one thing…. For role-players like me I would like if u could interact with things. Like for a example if you could bake. Thanks for reading|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-20 06:40:36-07:00|Arctic Wolf gems plz because it’s way to slow to earn sapphires in the game and I like Arctic Wolf|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-20 00:18:46-07:00|I want my dang account back now!|Animal Jam|1.0
2022-02-19 21:28:59-07:00|So I have 6 or 5 dollars and I used them to get sapphires and then animal jam crashed and I went back on and NO SAPPHIRES. Please fix this I don’t want this to happen to other people. |Animal Jam|2.0
2022-02-19 15:52:17-07:00|Okay I LOVE ANIMAL JAM! But now it is not how I remember people don’t even notice me when I say “ happy Valentine’s Day!” Or something like that. They are just like “ trade me rares” and I am confused. I cannot communicate with people anymore and it’s sad.just saying people rarely talk to me unless I say I’ll give you items if you talk to me… so yea i DO NOT LIKE THAT.  So I’d like you to know that AJHQ. Thanks for reading this far.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-19 14:44:38-07:00|This game is bad because the “buy bundle” purchases the items without asking if you’re sure that you want them. The “buy bundle” and the “bundle on/off” button are too close to each other. One slight accident and you’re wasting your sapphires on something you don’t want. Then you have to waste time getting more sapphires.|Animal Jam|1.0

2020-05-15 12:17:35-07:00|The only thing I like about this app and website is that I can see my daughter's work. Customer support is horrible. I can’t change my daughter log in information so every time she gets logged out I have to message the teacher for a new code. With internet being spotty she is getting logged out a lot. She is now behind in her school work because I have to keep getting new codes and waiting for the support team to decide to help me. As far as my daughter doing her work the tools end up covering the bottom portion of her work so she can’t see it without constantly hiding the tools. The class work is just everywhere. I absolutely hate this app/website and will be glad when she switches over to google classroom next year.|Seesaw Parent and Family|1.0

2020-04-28 12:48:12-07:00|Great have a love it by the way except the fact is every time someone post something or they do understand it just comes up and I do you want me and it leaves like a little mark so you have to click on it and get rid of it but I also don’t like when you have a real app because they usually use it what happens is that when you leave it for like five minutes and you come back on to arm the page or doing it just goes away everything you’ve been working on for the past few hours or minutes there 30 minutes just goes away to start all over so I wish I could do something about that.|Seesaw Parent and Family|4.0
2020-04-22 15:52:56-07:00|I downloaded the app because my kids think it is fun and they want to draw and create mini movies. Their teacher gave us a QR code to scan at home. When I first opened the app it told me scan a QR code my teacher has gave us. I scanned it but it said it was a class code. Then what code is it suppose to be? Teachers are suppose to give you codes to use at home? This is so confusing. That’s all I got through. Please answer because my kids really want to use this app.|Seesaw Parent and Family|1.0

2020-04-20 20:00:20-07:00|Seesaw has been pretty easy to navigate. I like that is connected to GSuite and I have a Microsoft Surface that makes it easy to navigate. I have a kindergartner and he likes that activities his teacher have both created and uploaded from the shared lessons. The microphone is also of good recording quality. Things I wish this product would offer:1) I have to use my own snipping tool to re-post responses, it would be great if this was integrated. To be able to pull the original document that was posted and be able to write on it.2) Why does this tool not use stickers ? Elementary teachers always use stamps and stickers when they respond to school work. Thta would be awesome.|Seesaw Parent and Family|5.0

Thank you Seesaw!|Seesaw Parent and Family|5.0
2020-04-09 19:28:58-07:00|For such a simple app, the functionality is poor. The kindergarten teacher tells us to retrieve schoolwork from the activities folder; I can’t find one from my iPhone, the brand new iPad, or my laptop. The second grade teacher asked that I add her class to the Seesaw account; that can’t be done without the paper that can’t currently be provided. The code provided only works for entirely new accounts, not for adding a second child to the family account. I appreciate the opportunity for teachers to send pictures and communicate easily if it’s easy for them, but as a parent, the program is a dysfunctional headache.|Seesaw Parent and Family|2.0
2020-04-09 11:20:10-07:00|I really like this program for what it’s created for, but I wish seesaw would allow for a calender, so future class events could be viewed in one spot. Maybe because of covid and the need for homeschooling and trying to organize everything I really feel this is needed now. Zoom meetings, other events, would just be nice to go to one place to find this information, rather than looking through the messages sections for an update or uploaded pdf, or emails, or google docs.|Seesaw Parent and Family|5.0

2020-04-06 08:18:49-07:00|Not sure why school district selected this half baked product. Two parents cannot have separate accounts for the same child. Cannot even add more than one email. Cannot even add more than one phone number. So basically, all notifications can only go to one parent’s email address and phone number. Despite paying so much taxes, this is the app they selected for us!|Seesaw Parent and Family|1.0

Also, this platform doesn’t work on Mac Safari at all, and is very buggy on Chrome and Firefox. Avoid if you can!|Seesaw Parent and Family|1.0
2020-04-02 10:59:08-07:00|This is definitely a great app. I am a student and use it at school.Since of the Coronavirus this school year my teacher said that we can use this app at home and post stuff. But this really is a great app for school.|Seesaw Parent and Family|5.0

2020-03-31 09:11:00-07:00|As a student this is organized when a child works in their own account. However, as a parent resource, this app is incredibly frustrating and unorganized if you have more than one child. The posts are added by your children’s teacher and isn’t sorted by student. This makes everything a constant mixed social feed and makes you spend more time trying to find resources and feeds, vs. actually pulling up the per child activities. Significant improvements could be made in this app for parent use.|Seesaw Parent and Family|1.0
2020-03-26 17:56:56-07:00|This is. User experience nightmare. Unread message and notification icons don’t reset or change numbers when you read messages. Neither us or the kid can respond to or like posts that other student can due to a mystery bug so the kid can’t participate in the projects. Her only options are to generate a QR code which my 7 year old needs ...why??? Videos say “object not found” or “this video isn’t ready to play”. Messages appear on a different feed than notifications -why not just give them different icon or color? Getting to messages I have to click class announcements to even see them (why are we reinventing the concept of inbox?). Worst, for the life of me, I can’t understand why I need a class app AND a family app with the same username/password that show some of the same posts but responding to the feed of one doesn’t show up in the other.  Don’t even get me started on the discombobulated registration/approval process. It’s also not paperless; every project here I need to send to my printer and this must go through texting myself because this app can’t send anything to print. As a UX/UI designer with 17 years experience -I hope this gets fixed or disappears along with that darn coronavirus.|Seesaw Parent and Family|1.0

2021-07-26 12:11:29-07:00|I played this game ages ago and remember it being pretty fun. I haven’t been feeling well lately (not Covid, thankfully!) so wanted to put some games back on my iPhone. I was super excited to play this one again, assuming that since I haven’t played it since it was first released there’s probably been good updates done, improving gameplay. Well, imagine my frustration and disappointment now that the game simply won’t open! I just keep getting an error message saying, “lost connection: the connection with our server is lost. Please check your connectivity and try again. Code 88.” Nothing I do fixes this! Using WiFi, using data, hard closing and restarting the app…nothing :( and it’s not my internet, I’ve run speed tests and diagnostics. So for now it’s getting the lowest review available. If anything changes and/or the developers try to help I’ll change my review to reflect that. How disappointing this is though :(|House Flip|1.0

They told me there was nothing they could do for me, couldn’t revert anything or give me extra hearts to get me back to where I was. I liked the game and decided to start over, recently even started paying the subscription price to get back to my spot faster. Takes forever to get hearts and thought starting a squad gives you 500 hearts... actually CHARGES u 500 hearts. Asked if they could revert that I did not realize and it was unclear. They said no. For someone paying to play your game you’d think you’d realize giving back 500 hearts would be a better choice rather than lose a customer. I’ll be deleting that app!|House Flip|1.0
2021-07-14 15:34:23-07:00|Got the game because I saw it had prime rewards and looked like a really fun app game to play in my spare time. Worked fine the first time I opened the app. Tried working on my second house and the app just doesn’t let me play the game properly. When I click on something it doesn’t show the options for it or it just doesn’t register I clicked on it. Even if I press it multiple times.

2021-07-07 20:42:17-07:00|For some annoying reason, the app keeps booting me out of the game and sending me “home” (home page on phone)Lately, it has gotten to the point where I can’t do ANY renovations! It is really bugging me and it is making me seem unreliable to my team members because when I partner up with them, I am somehow able to make a single (sometimes two or three) renovation on the house; which means we can’t sell the house . . .One of my other apps has been doing this too . . .|House Flip|3.0

2021-07-02 11:51:44-07:00|This game is definitely fun and lets my creativity come out.  The gameplay is easy to understand & can easily be played without using real money.  What has me lowering my stars are the numerous moments of not being able to renovate certain items in a room.  Things don’t load properly for me to choose or confirm an item, keeping me from fully completing a house.  I’m constantly having to reboot my device (despite it being the latest version) to get things to load & even then things still don’t load.  I’m about ready to delete this app in all honesty, so here’s hoping this issue gets fixed soon.|House Flip|3.0
2021-07-02 09:34:05-07:00|so I gave it 5 stars so it can be seen so i actually want to give it 3 stars reason why is because the only way to get alot of money when you can't afford too buy a house is waiting a day or buying money and why are the groups so expensive?|House Flip|5.0
2021-06-17 04:51:55-07:00|This game is fantastic!

I saw this app again in the App Store today and Thought I should try it again. I looked at all of the new stuff they added and it looked like a lot of Awesome Ideas !  Love this app! I recommend if you are bored! This game is incredibly addictive! Love it!|House Flip|5.0
2021-06-13 15:53:24-07:00|It asked to track what I do on my device so it can give me personalized ads. Nobody likes ads anyways and the game hardly ever has ads!!

Just show me ads… I’ll watch them. But I will not let you have access to my personal information.  This is what it says “Thanks for being a fan of our app!

Not thanks.|House Flip|2.0

2021-04-09 15:52:30-07:00|So the first app like this I downloaded was Property Brothers. That game really annoyed me cuz it was so rigged so I searched for others and lo and behold I found this! It’s so much better than Property Brothers, there’s no “other” game you need to play to earn stuff and you can strategize to earn more. You do have to wait tho for your jobs to finish but it isn’t that long, you can play another fun game and turn on notifications so you can get right back to renovating. I love this game and highly recommend you download it!|House Flip|5.0
2021-04-08 15:53:59-07:00|I literally love this game so much but I do wish you would get more money . When you flip a house I play this game every day and I absolutely love love love it. I Also wish that Chip and J.O. would have some dialogue like when they buy and sell the house and i also wish that there was a store that you bought supplies from. Other wise I literally love this game!!!|House Flip|5.0

2021-07-12 06:59:10-07:00|As a busy mom, I am so grateful for the Homer app! My daughter asks to have iPad time for Homer specifically. Before school let out, I was given a list of areas that my Naomi needed to work on prior to school starting in the fall as determined by her teachers. Homer actually gave a quick pre- assessment questionnaire  in order to make a targeted learning path for her— I was so pleased to see that the path they created for her was exactly what her teachers said she needed to practice. There is a good mix of engaging reading and writing practice and Naomi is able to navigate with little to no help from me. Her brother (8) actually likes to do the work with her sometimes, laughing alongside her to the funny stories and cheering her on when she does the practices correctly. As a teacher and mother, I highly recommend!|HOMER Learn & Grow|5.0

2021-06-23 14:20:47-07:00|Homer charges a subscription about as much as Netflix with only the smallest fraction of content Netflix offers. Most of the content is just curated from other sources, basically the same as just creating bookmarks in your browser when you find a good video on YouTube. As an educator, I find a lot their custom content to be highly questionable in execution. Like many similar apps, they favor “engagement” over sound learning strategy, so that a child left alone with the tablet could just keep clicking buttons, even while they’re being distracted and confused by what the focus of the learning is. My opinion is that this method would slow or derail a child’s comprehension rather than reinforcing or expediting it. On technical level, there are a number of crashes and glitches we’ve experienced though it functions well most of the time. It’s VERY frustrating that you need to be online to use all content. They charge $10 a month and don’t even have an offline feature for trips or time away from WiFi. Disappointing to say the least.|HOMER Learn & Grow|1.0

2021-05-18 15:04:54-07:00|During the last year we were all sick on quarantine, and in desperation gave my under two toddler an iPad with homer on it to buy us a bit more time to sleep. She loves it. But more than that, the next week she climbed onto my lap and accurately identified a quarter of the letters on my laptop we had not been working with her on them at all previously, so she had to have learned from the app. Now several months later, she knows all her letters, including some lower case. She can identify numbers too, and can accurately count objects in groups. Homer really helped our inquisitive baby get a head start on learning!|HOMER Learn & Grow|5.0

I would at least appreciate being able to ask the company WHAT is going on and how can we troubleshoot. Instead, there’s absolutely no support.

2021-03-16 14:55:17-07:00|There is a complete lack of diversity. There’s plenty of “majority” representation, but very little for any marginalized groups. There are significantly more talking animals than people of color and the general “holiday” section is almost completely US based or Christian holidays. Only 2 holiday videos show any diversity, for hanukkah, but it’s clear watching them that they were written by a person who has never celebrated the holiday themselves. I emailed the customer service team and was told they’re “still working” on their commitment to diversity. Still working?? This app was released in 2013, if they haven’t figured out by now how to honor that “commitment” they aren’t even trying. I also asked if there was a way to opt out of the religious content, since it’s only focused on one religion, and was told no.

He’s in the pre-reader stage and while the activities are easy for him to complete, they are very purposeful and keep him moving along. For instance, breaking down a word into 2 parts (I.e. app says ta-ble and he has to pick the picture of the table) to get him used to sounding words out. So far, so good. The app itself is smooth. No glitches so far and it doesn’t take forever to load.|HOMER Learn & Grow|5.0

My 3 year old will be on a lesson where she is supposed to pick the letter “M” for example, but she can click on the cat that meows or makes a noise and she will press it over and over and not do the work. I also don’t love the way the “am” and “an” sounds are taught. They aren’t teaching how Americans pronounce them. It actually sounds British.

By Christmastime, she still did not know her ABC’s well, and was not doing well with reading. I was unsure of what to do next, but knew something different needed to be done. I decided to try Homer. It has been the best thing we have ever done to help our youngest in her early education. After using Homer for 2 months, my daughter can confidently say and write the alphabet in order. She can also read many sight words and sound out many others. She is not only learning so much from this app, but she loves doing it. Even at night she wants to do her “school”.

2014-04-14 16:00:26-07:00|I think that coloring is a good game, but  I think that the people that make it should add more colors to choose from. I also think that you should be able to color more real pictures. This game is boring and fun:(  :)|My Coloring Book Free|3.0

It was by far the best app. The images of the baby every week are very beautiful and realistic, the information is so useful, and the app is so user friendly.

2021-08-06 12:45:11-07:00|My husband and I were trying to conceive for 6.5 years and when we got pregnant after our first medicated cycle we were very nervous. I downloaded a bunch of apps like the baby center and the glow apps and they were great but they both had communities which is usually great but for me only increased my anxiety. People posted about their early or second trimester losses and though they have every right to be talked about and need to be it made me so scared and not able to enjoy my pregnancy at all. I deleted those apps and downloaded this one after reading reviews and I am so thankful and impressed with it. It is much better than the other apps in general and doesn’t have the communities. It’s helped my anxiety ten fold!|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0
2021-08-01 16:59:46-07:00|One minute it works on my phone. Then the next, it doesn’t want to anymore. It keeps shorting out on my phone every time I try to open up the app. This new update is horrible.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|1.0

2021-06-21 19:32:37-07:00|The app kicked me off. I am not able to log back in. I have all my information saved on it like baby data and names.

I wrote it down and put it in my photos by taking a screen shot of the email and password when I made them. I even tried to reset my password but nothing worked. This has really upset me. This app is very useful the images are wonderful and details are great. The options it gives help you feel more organized and prepared.

2021-06-18 16:11:38-07:00|This is my favorite pregnancy app and I’ve used it for all three of my pregnancies! The articles about how my baby is growing and what’s happening to my body that specific week is my favorite part and has been very accurate for me personally. When I was 9 weeks pregnant with my third, I started feeling really hormonal and nauseous…I opened up the app and it literally said that this week I might feel more nauseous and hormonal than before! It then went on to share different ways I could help nauseous etc. This type of thing has happened multiple times on this app and I love that! I feel like it knows me haha. It’s filled with the kind of information I want during pregnancy. It’s also easy to use. I’ve recommended this app to all my pregnant friends|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0
2021-06-16 12:11:40-07:00|The amount of info this app gathers is far to intrusive. Please tone down the sensitive data you gather, I do not do business with companies that violate my privacy... sadly the list of companies who don’t is shrinking. That’s why it’s up to the consumer to avoid said companies.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|1.0
2021-06-11 14:22:54-07:00|I conceived on April 30, 2021. According to the app today I should be 8 weeks pregnant. I’m not. I’m only 6 weeks pregnant. We booked our dr appt. for today thinking I was 8 weeks pregnant. Our dr was very concerned with the size of our baby and schedule an ultrasound a week from now as he is concerned it is not growing correctly. He asks us when we think we conceived. I tell him. He responds “okay so 6 weeks.” I felt so dumb I had to open the app and show him where I was getting 8 weeks from! So embarrassing and scary since we all thought something must be seriously wrong. Otherwise, I have no problems with the app and appreciate the features.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|4.0

2021-06-08 07:24:50-07:00|Not impressed. The app has out dated information especially with Covid being around for over a year now. The contraction counter is not worth it. It deletes your timings and there are plenty of other great contraction apps out there that beat this by a mile. The kick counter is handy but I’ve found 4 or 5 other apps that out do this one by far.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|3.0
2021-06-05 14:14:18-07:00|but there’s one thing i’d like to know how to do, how do i change my amount of weeks i’m on? i went to the doctor recently and i’m actually more ahead than i thought i was. i’ve tried looking everywhere on the app but i can’t find where to change it. other than that i love this app! it’s very helpful with keeping track of everything. thank you!|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0

2021-05-14 14:09:10-07:00|Looks like a great app but the layout is very hard to understand. Especially the timeline it would be easier if it’s in a monthly layout.

2021-05-13 17:24:49-07:00|I’ve used this app my whole pregnancy up to 30 weeks but with the recent update it’s stopped working completely. The app asks you to create a new login or login with a shared website. I tried the login I have for the app and it failed. I created a new account (twice) and both times it failed.

2021-05-11 07:00:41-07:00|I love how real the baby looks, it’s my go-to app for visualization. An annoying problem is that while all the info I input into the app is the same as other apps to estimate how far along and the baby size, the estimated baby size/length are a week ahead of every other app I use AND what my OB measures (and she says baby is right on track). I emailed them about this and it didn’t go anywhere.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|3.0

2021-05-10 11:11:40-07:00|This new update is making me create an account through a 3rd party so they can get more information from me but the app was perfect before. I'll have to uninstall if they don't fix this because I am not creating an account.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|1.0
2021-05-10 04:56:57-07:00|I was excited when this app popped up because I used it with my first pregnancy with my son, and couldn’t wait to use it again. When I logged in, it kept saying my due date was out of bounds (because my son was born in 2018). When I tried to change the information to have a new due date, the app said that I would have to create a new Phillips account. So I tried to do that, only to be told that 2 accounts with the same email can’t exist. I do not have and do not want a second email. I’ve used several apps for both pregnancies so far and all of the other ones let me add a new pregnancy to an existing account. I’m not sure why this app thinks that you can only have one child, but it’s extremely disappointing.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|1.0
