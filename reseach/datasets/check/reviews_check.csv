2022-03-02 19:48:02-07:00|Duolingo has helped me greatly improve my Spanish on my own in these last 2+ years. However, as you get to the more advanced topics, you’re penalized for spending more time trying to really grasp a topic because if you’re spending time understanding and reviewing, you aren’t getting the same number of XP you could be getting speeding through lessons. It’s at the point where I have to decide if I want to maximize points to advance in the weekly contests or maximize the amount of true understanding I’m getting on topics. It would be awesome if Duo could somehow track the amount of active time you’re working on a lesson and reward you for taking the time to really understand a new topic.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0
2022-03-02 19:43:33-07:00|Given that I am I a fluent English speaker and only speak one language, I wanted to use an app that was free and helpful for learning to speak and understand another language. Duolingo is a popular choice among language learners so I decided to give it a try. I used the app for about a month before deleting it. Learning to speak the language with this app is not only hard, but also ineffective in helping me understand the language. For example, I was learning hangeul and I was supposed to listen to a voice saying the word and click on the answer that correlates with that word. Except when I clicked on the answer that sounded like that word, I was wrong. How was I supposed to know which answer was right when they all sounded the same? Not to mention, the robot voice is really unhelpful when trying to pronounce the words. I can barely hear the distinct sound of the word. Another thing, when I was first learning, I was bombarded by words I never even learned and duolingo wanted me to identify what the words were. I’ve never even seen the word in my life and it expected me to know what it sounded like and looked like? Ridiculous. Also, I never received lessons on how to identify the difference between two words that look almost alike. They just left it up to me to figure it out myself. All in all, I won’t ever be choosing to use this app to learn a language. I even tried Spanish! Still didn’t learn anything useful or complete my goal of learning and speaking a language.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|1.0
2022-03-02 19:41:53-07:00|It’s a clever well thought teaching app It teaches in a fun way At a slow pace reviewing  words over and over in different ways. I retain what I learn. You learn verb tenses as you go I enjoy using the app even after a full day at work I think everyone should learn multiple languages It is a enriching experience.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0

2022-03-02 17:08:19-07:00|Love the app on the phone and iPad, but why can’t I use my computer? Would love to use the larger screen and keyboard to avoid RSI, but the scoring and features on the web don’t match the app. If we can’t bring them in sync, can you allow the iPad app to be used on the M1 Mac? Otherwise … love it!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0
2022-03-02 16:50:08-07:00|They don’t got English what if little kids wanna speak better |Duolingo - Language Lessons|1.0
2022-03-02 16:48:18-07:00|Not sure if that’s the right term for it but ive noticed some features aren’t there anymore though it will still ask you to complete those features to gain your achievements. I’m a sucker for completing those goals so it’s really frustrating that it’s asking me to do timed practice when it isn’t even an accessible option. I did research on this and duolingo customer service has suggested to people to essentially modify some code to posssiblyyy bring it back on your device due to some A/B test or something. Lots of reviews said how if you write in about this, they likely won’t fix it. To us non tech people, that’s confusing and quite frustrating.Id suggest fixing the app so everyone has access to the same features or getting rid of the not-actually-possible achievements so people don’t even realize they aren’t getting everything they paid for () The learning itself is helpful. just a bummer when you pay for duolingo plus only to find out your app doesn’t give you all those features.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|2.0
2022-03-02 16:45:27-07:00|This app is really good because I speak Creol and English but no one ever really taught me Creol, I can’t really speak in Creol but when someone saids something in Creol I can kinda understand what they say, but now I know more words than I knew before my cousin recommended this because she also is learning it to so shout out to her!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 16:22:12-07:00|So I have to change my review. Previously I thought duo was overhyped bc it dealt with just translating and not much learning. But now, depending on what language you’re learning, they have a lot to offer. Spanish for example has reading sections, listening sections, and podcasts in addition to the regular activities. And you can actually read about the grammatical structures so you understand it. They still have improvements to make, most languages don’t have much content and even the more popular languages like Spanish could improve the more complex grammar lessons, but I’m sure I’ll end up editing this review again in a couple years.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0
2022-03-02 16:15:01-07:00|Today March 2, 2022 the Duolingo App for ipad isn’t working better since in the morning at 9:00 in my time. I have update my ipad. I reported that when you click on the application doesn’t respond, it’s crash. Please resolve this problem. Thank you. My money is better so the service must be good. Thank you|Duolingo - Language Lessons|3.0
2022-03-02 16:04:13-07:00|I really like this app because I have family in Italy and I don’t know how to speak this app has been helping a lotttt and I really love it |Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 16:02:05-07:00|I started using the app about 10 days ago. I set my daily lesson for 10 minutes. You start the lesson and next thing you know it’s done because the lessons really engage you and keep your attention. I have already recommended this app to multiple other people. I most definitely give this app !!!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 15:14:39-07:00|A great App with easy learning and helps you learn a new language or relearn an old one! Well worth the download!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0

2022-03-02 14:28:23-07:00|I did my best to follow this app and had a 12 day streak going. I earned enough “crowns/jewels” to get 350 hearts so I could make mistakes while learning but when I cashed them in they disappeared. So, since you can only learn if you have hearts-aka paid app subscript I ended up disappointed and deleted the app. I am a teacher. Seems to me that this is counterintuitive to leaning. Especially for those who do not have unlimited resources and cannot pay for an app that touts itself as free only to find that if you make a mistake you cannot learn more Without paying for it. You get only 5 hearts per day. Every mistake costs one heart btw.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|1.0
2022-03-02 14:14:41-07:00|I think this app deserves more than five stars but of course that is not possible the thing I am uncomfortable with is using the microphone from past experience ( including my talking Angela and a kidnapper experience) other wise this app should be promoted on to the Guinness book of world records for the best on in the state|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 12:58:34-07:00|Best foreign language tool I’ve ever seen. The animation makes it so much fun.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 12:50:06-07:00|I Like this it’s very understanding, enjoyable, better than Rosetta Stone. It is repetitive on some parts but that’s the best part in helping with memorizing and pronunciation.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 12:48:34-07:00|I think Duolingo is a great way to learn new languages just for the fun of learning or to see relatives and be able to talk to them easily. It definitely makes a difference. There are some things that you can say in one part of the country your learning and not in the other but other than that it’s wonderful!! I would definitely recommend it!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0
2022-03-02 12:43:59-07:00|Duolingo is the best ! I love this app. It helps you learn languages and even helps you study Hawaiian .this app is so cool and if you want to lean a language and don’t know where to start use Duolingo , even if you know a language already you take a short five minute quiz to see where you are and how they can help you . I rate this app a five out of five stars ,get this app guys!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 12:29:16-07:00|Great app for learning another language really the only thing to complain about are the lives system you only get 5 and of you make to many mistakes you can’t access any lessons anymore except practice mode which is the only way to get lives instantly without paying with gems or the stupid subscription service, you can earn gems by leveling up and finishing goal’s. Overall good app just annoying features, also hate the adds to intrusive l, also the bird is scary please take away the bird his notifications scare me|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 12:28:02-07:00|Make Duolingo just be Duolingo plus please do it as soon as you get this message!!!!!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0
2022-03-02 12:12:45-07:00|I give duolingo 100 million stars because they make learning languages super duper fun! I am learning russian and when I tried from youtube, it was difficult but when I downloaded duolingo, I can show off to my sister! RECOMMEND THIS APP SO MUCH!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 08:11:27-07:00|For those who are starting out in learning Japanese, such as, you are an absolute beginner, I wouldn’t recommend this app as it’ll overwhelm you with Kanji right from the start. I would highly recommend LingoDeer and its app, as it teaches you sentence structures as well as grammar (and vocabulary among other things) and that app is much helpful to get you started in learning. As someone who is intermediate in Japanese, I WOULD recommend this app for intermediate users as a testing app, as throwing Kanji and its use of complex sentence structures is really good for those who wish to take the JLPT anytime soon. Again, only for intermediate (N4 level) users that knows Kanji, and intermediate grammar. THIS APP IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!EDIT: so they implemented the key system; you can spend gems to get a regular key OR you can pay for the UNLIMITED KEY… since they made this change, I don’t think that I can recommend this app anymore, unless your okay to spend money on this yearly. There’s better alternatives to learning Japanese, such as using LingoDeer… And if you want to test yourself, there’s Migi…|Duolingo - Language Lessons|2.0
2022-03-02 07:51:04-07:00|Learning Spanish on this easy to use and encouraging language learning app. It’s simple, progresses appropriately, and it’s game of five to keep you competing with a few other people. They’ve also given the feature of adjuvant or paid subscription driven usage. This is wonderful as their goal is to provide a free language learning app for people that is universally available. I believe these developers have set a high goal and achieved it. Highly recommended language appUpdate: Learning Greek is not as good though on here. Teaching you “ Pink Rice” many times, which is not useful nor a dish in Greece. thats the drop from 5 to 4. Needs normal word phrases.Otherwise, great!|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0
2022-03-02 07:43:53-07:00|I Love This App, I Love it Because It Let’s Me Learn Japanese And French And All Different languages, And That’s What I Love About Duolingo|Duolingo - Language Lessons|5.0
2022-03-02 06:14:23-07:00|While the app itself runs well, the lessons contained within are very poor. The new material that Duolingo has been adding, especially on the English to German course, shouldn’t have been let out of testing. As much as I hate to say it, duolingo should quit making “improvements” to the app and start making improvements to the content|Duolingo - Language Lessons|2.0
2022-03-02 06:04:52-07:00|Ok so Duolingo is amazing I truly love it but i do Duolingo in the morning like before I get dressed which is at like 6:45 and so Duolingo with alert me but that is not the problem the problem is the notifications make you fee like you need to practice because the notifications will say like IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE IF YOU LOST YOUR 37 day streak so you should really practice”… and so it is kinda like mean or annoying so if you could just ask the notifications to say like “let’s get practicing” that would be great my second problem is yay I have been learning the exact same thing ever since I got Duolingo I have not learned something new and it is really annoying so if you could make the levels not teach us the same thing that would a little bit nice because like now I’m getting bored of Duolingo it is not fun anymore but thank you for a good app that can teach me all sorts of languages|Duolingo - Language Lessons|4.0
2022-03-02 05:46:25-07:00|I’m going on and off duolingo but I lost my steak because I was away for a bit longer than I should have been. When I bought a streak repair that said it cost 500 it lagged out so I pressed it a couple times to see if my screen was frozen. When it stopped lagging, my gems went from 16## to 6## (I don’t remember the last two digits) Duolingo please fix this so it doesn’t happen again or to others. It ruined my experience, I was thinking of grinding again but now it doesn’t feel fun anymore.|Duolingo - Language Lessons|3.0
2022-03-02 04:46:27-07:00|I’ve been using Duolingo for at least 73 days now and the only thing that could be improved is if I turn off my iPod the app crashes and I need to restart the lesson. Also, I have Duolingo plus and there’s a feature (something to do with leagues) and I can’t access it. I’d really appreciate it if you could make a separate league section for plus members. I pay for that subscription and it’s annoying that I don’t have access to this. However this is still a great language learning app and you should definitely get it.

2022-03-02 04:02:43-07:00|I am mad that Duolingo has in game “hearts” because if you make a mistake and have zero “gems” on one “heart” you will have to leave the lesson if you don’t have “plus”.

Im fluent in english, and it asked me to translate from french to english and say it. And i did that, but it didn’t work at all for me, so i always say i cant speak right now.3.

Photomath can solve word problems but i recently tried multiple word problems but it couldn’t solve the word problems because they didn’t recognize it.

Even word word problems, this app solves my problems in seconds and all you have to do is download, take a photo, and boom you have your answers. No wonder why there were so many ratings on this app. I would give it 100 stars if I could. Best app ever. I never ever in my life have written a review on app before (because I’m to lazy to) but this app made me write one. I thought this app was a joke at first like I thought no way can a app answer your homework problems for you. But NO this app was no cap whatsoever. ( I rhymed haha) I was so shocked when this app worked. Lately I have been so tired and stressed out over my homework but this app literally does it for me. But I know this using this app is basically cheating, so I won’t use it all the time. But still, best app ever. I wrote this review right away after a couple of minutes after I installed this on my phone. Like I was in shock so I wrote a review as fast as I could. Everyone needs this app. I DEFINITELY recommend it!|Photomath|5.0

I can’t say enough wonderful things about the Teacher and all the extra time and effort that they take for every child in their class to pass on extra information or letting us know what’s missed if your child is out so you know what needs to be done to keep the child on task and up to date where the rest of the class is.

2022-03-02 18:14:07-07:00|This game is never boring.  Actually, I love this game!  However, the Hints and the Rockets to help solve the puzzles are too close to the circle with the letters.  Every hint or rocket I’ve purchased was by accident.  There should be a “confirm” or “decline” purchase option for each purchase.  Considering the prize for each solved round is 25 cents, the hints should be 50 cents and the rockets $2.00 (or 200 cents).|Wordscapes|3.0

It takes “app” but not “mic”. Abbreviated words there’s no rhyme or reason. The puzzles are not that challenging and I use it for just quiet down time. (The puzzles could be a bit more challenging actually.) But mostly just needs a better database. Thanks!|Wordscapes|3.0

2022-03-02 11:45:18-07:00|The game is fine. But, after certain levels the same puzzles repeat over and over. I’m at the point wheee I can solve the game without even looking at the puzzle.  Also, the portrait game in the game is ridiculous. You can never unlock the secret puzzle,  No matter how much you play. Why even have this in the game?  I would give this game 5 stars if you got rid of the portraits and actually had new word games on the higher levels.|Wordscapes|2.0

SUGGESTION: For write, I like that you can choose I was right if it marks it incorrectly but sometimes my teacher puts the part of speech after the term and if I forget that, it says its wrong. So I feel like there should be three options jf you get it wrong: I was right, I clicked the wring letter(reworded), and Study later. Otherwise, Quizlet RULES!!

2022-01-24 14:02:01-07:00|Don’t get me wrong I love this game, it gets very addicting, well sometimes. The game used to have no ads at all! You would just play and play and play with no interruptions, and yeah it would be fine if there were ads after you lose all your lives, but not in the middle of a turn! The game has now turned from fun into annoying to play. This is not only with this game, with other games to, I also get that they have to make money and that the game is free, but if they could just reposition the ads so they don’t interrupt gameplay, then that would be fine. If a player is reading this, I suggest buying the no ads feature. Besides all that, fun game! |Dumb Ways to Die|3.0

2021-12-19 14:19:22-07:00|This game is fun to sit down and play for a few minutes, and it’s nice that you’ve been supporting this game for many years, but the advertisements are very annoying. They pop up too much.I’d say that a more reasonable advertisement break would be if you lose all of your lives.Also, I had an issue with an advertisement that would never end and it didn’t have an exit option. I was forced to close down the game and lose my high score of around 4500.The game itself would be 4 stars, but the advertisements push it down to 3. Please fix the issue I had above as well!|Dumb Ways to Die|3.0

2022-01-27 21:38:31-07:00|This used to be a fun app to explore. Lists of related words with stories of their origin etc. I PURCHASED an additional component, the rhyming dictionary in addition to the free app. This did not protect me from the obnoxious, random ad pages that cover the screen and can’t be closed for so long it completely ruins the experience. The impossible to get rid of ads also play loud music/noises even with the volume down.  Worse, once you eventually close the page hog it will return. It has been forced on you so long you can’t avoid seeing what it is for, so rejecting the same ad over and over is stupid marketing. You can look up a word still and face less advertising, but it takes longer to open the app than it does to just google the word. The value in the app was exploring other words. The in-depth info was well written and could keep a word lover happily occupied for a half hour. Someone worked hard on that content and it was always interesting and educational. No more. That’s gone behind ad walls it is not worth breaking through.|Dictionary.com: English Words|1.0

2022-03-01 19:37:39-07:00|This app is fantastic, it’s much easier than having to pull out my computer every time I want to check grades, messages, etc and helps me keep on track. The “to-do” feature is especially helpful, as it’s basically a planner built into my phone without me having to do any work! It’s a great way to check my assignments easily without having to click on every class to see them.The reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5, though, is because of the amount of duplicate messages and emails I get, as well as the structure of them. Every notification of a new grade, assignment date change, etc is delivered to my phone twice- which isn’t awful, it just gets really irritating after a while. The other reason is the emails I get tend to be pretty unhelpful- such as, “your assignment in x class was graded,” but it doesn’t tell me the grade in the email, so what’s the point of sending it?Overall, though, there are definitely more pros than cons to this app, so I’m not going to complain about it too much :)|Canvas Student|4.0

2022-03-01 11:38:07-07:00|I don’t believe that it’s fair to any parents that can’t afford to use your program to stay connected to the teacher & Childrens progress, so that they can encourage they’re students to see rewards and such through their parents at home. Shouldn’t offer it as a way to stay connected because you can’t stay connected|ClassDojo|1.0
2022-03-01 07:29:04-07:00|This is a great way to keep in contact with your child’s classroom and teacher(s).

2022-02-27 06:17:28-07:00|It’s an awesome app in order for everyone to communicate. It needs to have some upgrades in regards to distinguishing between the last school calendar year and current. It also should be much easier to log in over your child goes to the next grade. You shouldn’t have to continue every year to get new log in info every time the child changes a teacher. Sometimes it picks up old log in info and it’s difficult for the new school year to log in with your child’s new teacher!

Having “DO YOU WANT TO UPGRADE” on every single option that isn’t available on the free app prompt dojo plus when you touch it is incredibly annoying.Then you compound it by making the prompt difficult to leave and move away from. It’s so annoying I have to close the app in frustration.Unfortunately, I have to come back to it to see my child’s progress and the app again tries to BEG me to pay you. I don’t want to.

2022-02-28 21:24:22-07:00|The App Library is a new Home Screen on your iPhone and iPad. It was introduced in iOS 14 and iPadOS 15, you can remove certain home screens on your Home Screen to make it easier to get to the App Library, here’s a few tips for the App Library 1. It organizes all of your apps and games on your iPhone and iPad The App Library is used for organizing your apps and games and puts them into several categories like games, social, utilities, productivity and finance, shopping and food, entertainment, photo and video, and more 2. Search for apps and games To search for a app or game, just tap the search bar in the App Library and type in the name of the app or game then tap it to open it3. Can I disable App Library on iOS 14 and iPadOS 15Unfortunately though, you are unable to disable the App Library all together, this feature is required to stay on your device, but you don’t have to use it, apple putted the App Library on your very last page of your Home Screen, and all you need to do is avoid swiping left on your last page of your Home Screen then you will forget it exists, but however, there are some settings you need to change before you start ending up with a situation that you have to use the App Library 1. Make sure downloaded apps and games don’t save to App Library Its possible to send new apps and games straight to the App Library to avoid cluttering up your home screens, but if you don’t want this to happen, here’s what you need to do, open settings on your iPhone or iPad, then tap Home Screen, then under newly downloaded apps, select add to Home Screen, this will make your apps and games appear on the Home Screen rather than getting sent to the App Library 2. Make sure apps are not remaining in the App Library when not on the Home Screen Its possible to have apps remain in the App Library and not on the Home Screen, when deleting an app, its possible to take apps off the Home Screen to the App Library only, just make sure you tap delete app to permanently remove it from your device 3. Make sure your home screens are visible One reason why Apple introduced the App Library, its because some people were pretty frustrated, disappointed, and unhappy on how very cluttered their home screens had become, in previous iOS versions you were forced to put one of your apps on one place on your Home Screen leaving you with countless screens of messy apps, but with App Library, that’s no longer the case, Apple now offers the option to remove home screens for your needs, if you have trouble finding a certain app to get to, then you’re probably finding an app that’s sitting in a Home Screen that’s not visible, tap and hold anywhere on your homepage, then tap the dots button above your dock, then tap the check icon to add the homepage back.4. Remove the App Library icon from iPad dock on iPadOS 15If you have an iPad running iPadOS 15, then you’ll notice the App Library icon in the dock of your iPad, to remove it, open settings, then tap Home Screen and Dock, then under dock, turn off show App Library in dock, then when you leave the settings app, you’ll then see that the App Library icon is no longer remaining in your dock 5. Try using spotlight search If you don’t want to go to the App Library just to find an app to get to, then try using spotlight search on your Home Screen, swipe down from the middle of the screen to reveal a search tab, then type in the name of the app, then tap it to open it.I hope these tips were helpful|Tips|1.0

2022-02-11 10:20:43-07:00|I just don’t get it. We downloaded Kahoots to play quizzes with kids but most of them seem to be really above kid level or they don’t seem to be quizzes at all. A lot of them seem like they are just lectures on what or how we she think or feel. I understand people are allowed to make their own quizzes but if it’s not really a quizz then, what is this even for? I just deleted the app because it’s too hard to find an actual quiz or anything age or grade appropriate.If it had better quizzes and they moderated them to some degree to ensure they are actually quizzes, and maybe had age and grade level categories we’d probably use it again.|Kahoot!

For reference, I played the general trivia, but one of the questions was “what is the capital of Spain?” Even thought the true correct answer is Madrid, Kahoot marked me wrong and said it was Barcelona.Another question asked “how many planets are there in the universe?” Well, that’s uncountable, but Kahoot’s answer was 9, for the number of planets in our solar system (if you’re counting Pluto as well).

I’ve tried to log in and see if it helps, but it is still the same. And today I tried downloading it on my iPhone and it’s still the same. I think you may have to be a teacher or professional to do it? I don’t know, but I’m currently logged in as a student and it doesn’t seem to be showing me to make my Kahoot public. With that said, maybe there is a way that I’m just not finding it or not seeing it. But what a fun game if your child is homeschooled or remote!|Kahoot! Play & Create Quizzes|4.0

I don’t know why this is happening. I checked and my internet is good and all the other cables I just don’t get what’s the matter because it just does that for no reason. Also my last complaint is that when I type in answers it loads something else. When I go to host a game and when it DOSENT glitch me out, I go to type in the question and answer but it just puts something diff in.

My main and only issue being a bug that causes letters to be duplicated all too regularly. How do I know it’s OneNote and not just the iPad settings? Well, I’ve used three different keyboards, one of which had few issues because it is primarily a gaming keyboard for Windows with Bluetooth capability, and two, the other two keyboards work just fine in anything other than OneNote.

2022-02-22 05:37:00-07:00|One Note gets great reviews on the Web which is mystifying because the reviews ignore the problems. The program has a number of great features. It works across platforms. The basic idea of a program that lets you collect and organize notes fills a real need. That said the program has a number of poorly implemented features. The sync feature works poorly. It does a terrible job of uploading large pdf files. It is surprisingly difficult to rename and delete files. The ability to create outlines in pages is poorly done. I will continue to use it but I’m mystified why Microsoft fails to address its glaring weaknesses.|Microsoft OneNote|3.0

I love the feature that lets me add additional space if needed. I love that I can select graph paper or lined paper depending on my needs. However, it is super glitchy and it’s very inconvenient when I am taking notes in class and all of a sudden it glitches and goes to the top of a page that’s a mile long with notes, then I have to scroll and scroll until I find my original spot. Lately, it’s been having problems syncing and is constantly working offline which basically doesn’t save my notes to my OneDrive.

2022-02-11 05:38:19-07:00|This app tells the answer to any school question from math to history. But that’s not all it tells the reason of the answer and what was done to get that answer. Yes sometimes it doesn’t give the exact answer but that just means that the users can learn what to do! Socratic also gives the option to just learn, there is a section near the bottom where if you scroll up you see all the different subjects you can choose what you want to learn!|Socratic by Google|5.0

2022-02-26 13:30:24-07:00|I love this game so much! There is just one problem. I love all of the bug fixes but I want to have new areas for kids to play. There is also not a lot of boys activities and it makes me feel bad for my little brother. I am 8 years old and he is 7 years old he does not really play because there is not a lot of boys activities and there is more girl’s stuff like the makeup activity and washing a unicorn. There is also a lot of girl characters for the design your home activity. There is also a couple of girl characters on the activity on Arcadia where you have to fly and catch enough gems to get chests. And I think it is really unfair that there is more girls activities than boys. So If you could please add some more boys stuff on the next update that would be amazing and it would make my 7 year old brother want to play Kiddopia more and it would make him happy! Thank you so much. By: Rubie|Kiddopia - ABC Toddler Games|5.0

2022-01-28 07:54:14-07:00|I first downloaded this app for my son around 14/15 months. He is now almost 3.5 years old. During this time he has learned so many things from colors, cooking, home decorating, hand-eye coordination, an abundance of new vocabulary words through conversation about the game, prepositions, recycling, community helpers, and so much more. However, to get access to most content you have to pay for the app but to us it has been 100% worth it. There are so many different activities to play. My sons favorite is Kiddopia Town where he can experience different town buildings/places such as a home, toy store, beach, and a farm.|Kiddopia - ABC Toddler Games|5.0

I have multiple apps they are in app subscription and I can share in family sharing. Just weird how the would blame apple, when it’s clear that they just want you to buy two subscriptions. What a rip off. I even tried to sign in with my apple account on my spouses phone and it says I don’t have an account with Kiddopia all of a sudden. Bad taste in my mouth.

2022-02-13 15:17:43-07:00|This is a great app but it needs to be updated to integrate the use of the Apple Pencil.  The pencil will only work to open the app and choose which game but will not work within the games. I would rate this app 5 stars if this happened.|Lumosity: Brain Training|4.0
2022-02-13 03:56:23-07:00|I just paid for a 1-year subscription but am still locked out of all the premium content. They obviously have a data synchronization problem between the Apple App Store and their subscription management system. They should really remove the app from the Apple Store until they get this fixed. Stealing customers money without providing them access to your app is a reputation risk. Based on other reviews it’s an issue you haven’t cared enough to fix for over 3 years. I’ve learned my lesson to always read the reviews first. Thought this was a reputable app, but I guess not… you need to make it easier for people to either get access to the subscription they’ve already paid for, or get a refund directly through you. Forget customer service, you have a whole end-to-end customer experience problem.|Lumosity: Brain Training|1.0
2022-02-08 15:34:02-07:00|Time for some new content Please!  I’m a Long time user of this app and  I like using it daily, but we do need new content occasionally to keep it fun and interesting.  It’s been a few years since any new games were introduced.  I will be dropping the paid version if know new games soon.|Lumosity: Brain Training|3.0
2022-02-05 04:35:24-07:00|Of all the brain games I play, many of the games here are more challenging, especially when there is a speed component involved. It does become a bit easier once the games become familiar, but it is still challenging.|Lumosity: Brain Training|5.0
2022-02-01 16:39:49-07:00|I’m enjoying the mental athletics, but hate that I have to hold my iPad vertically to use the app. Please fix this!!|Lumosity: Brain Training|2.0
2022-02-01 07:13:50-07:00|Have tried to subscribe to this App twice. Each time it doesn’t let me log on. Checked help forums and info on Google, but nothing worked. This should be an easy fix, but there is no way to chat with support. One has to submit an email and wait AT LEAST two business days. So if you subscribe on a Saturday, the very earliest you will hear back from the help desk, assuming you do hear back, will be 4 days later.  The second time I subscribed, I submitted a help email, received an automated confirmation of my email, and 10 days later I have still not received a response. First time I’ve had this happen with an App. I submitted a follow up, asking about the status 4 days ago but haven’t heard back from my follow-up request. I give up!! I will play the free games but had to cancel my subscription cause I can’t pay for an App I can’t access.|Lumosity: Brain Training|1.0
2022-02-01 03:16:34-07:00|I don’t mind paying for the premium subscription, however, if I am to continue subscribing, I would at least like new games added every month or every other month. I do love the insights on how you guys break down the science behind how we play can correlate with or skills/industry. I recommend this app for a short period of time! Other than that, unless they make new updated games, don’t waste your money in the long run.|Lumosity: Brain Training|3.0
2022-01-31 12:31:00-07:00|I am paying for Luminosity premium. I’ve had it for years. I got a new phone and tried to ask for a forgotten password.

If you can’t fix it, I’ll have to cancel that credit card. Please help.|Lumosity: Brain Training|2.0
2022-01-27 17:22:42-07:00|We paid for a family plan and for weeks have been trying to get through and explain what happened w/no response. Finally get an email to show us how to log in . Dumb people working for a smart app?!!!|Lumosity: Brain Training|1.0

2022-01-26 17:00:07-07:00|The free version only allows you to play 3 recommended games per day.  While these games are fun and slightly challenging at first, they start to repeat very quickly, and I found myself groaning, “oh no, not this again!”Unlike other brain games out there, I didn’t get a sense of progress.  There were no achievements or rewards.  Moreover, I was unable to train in any specific categories.  This likely isn’t true if I were using the paid version, but how do I know for sure?!  You gotta give me a taste, man!Nearly every feature and a plethora of over 50 games are locked behind a pay wall.  A wall which I was never inspired to climb.  I’ve always been one to pay/support apps I enjoy, but sadly, this one seemed more nettlesome than fun or scientific or educational.  It left me asking, “why is this so popular?”  and thinking, “there are way more rewarding apps of this caliber which warrant my money because they made me say ‘give me more’ without giving me almost nothing.”|Lumosity: Brain Training|2.0
2022-01-25 18:59:17-07:00|Lumosity is an incredible app to have, if you have a desire for personal improvement, or just want to make your work life easier, it will improve your performance and make doing your job more comfortable. Lumosity can also be used to help deal with problems in your thinking process which could have developed from injuries or other circumstances. I believe it will help me personally in getting further in my job and doing better overall. It is definitely worth the cost, or just to be used with the free games it provides.|Lumosity: Brain Training|5.0

2022-01-18 20:17:45-07:00|like the app. solid.challenging but not too challenging.hot take: if word bubbles were to be released as its own app, i would literally be willing to pay for it. maybe not a lot, definitely not, like, monthly or anything, but i would. i love that minigame and have found no games with a similar structure. seriously.|Lumosity: Brain Training|4.0
2022-01-15 10:55:02-07:00|This is a great compliment to the website but there easy improvements to be made.

2021-12-27 07:35:57-07:00|Luminosity is the typical door opened to bring you into their scam to collect your personal information in an effort to get that money out of your pocket. There isn’t a product to help you recover from a brain injury like they advertise - if anything it’s a criminal scam. You can’t delete an account not fully created without logging in and giving more personal information. You can’t login to delete said account until you take multiple tests which allows them to collect personal data from you. There’s no phone number listed to contact them directly - another layer of scam.  No physical address listed to send them a letter requesting they delete your information - all scam levels under the guise of “good natured care”.  All that to sell your information to the mental health field and yes they will sell your personal, vulnerable information. It’s a scam.|Lumosity: Brain Training|1.0

2021-12-15 18:52:23-07:00|I enjoyed many of the games with the free version. Then I tried to upgrade during a Black Friday special. Somehow, I ended up with a costly monthly plan instead of the special, advertised at $35/year, so it seemed like a kind of bait & switch. All customer support told me was to ask for a refund from Apple. They apparently don’t offer direct help  and Apple/iTunes is not user-friendly at all these days. So overall I’d say the games are good but that the paid plans are a bit expensive and customer support doesn’t really do much.|Lumosity: Brain Training|3.0

2021-11-24 21:15:39-07:00|I enjoyed playing Lumosity for 8 years.   I had a premium membership for most of that time, but after no updates for the games and no new ones in years, the $59 a year renewal was too much to justify.   Yes, there were updates recently for bugs, but not like the beginning of my stint when we got new games or the existing ones got new content.   I’ve put in feedback to no avail. Now it’s time to shut off auto-renew and find something else.  My thanks to the company for refunding the 2-year auto-renewal that just occurred last month.   I appreciate that it was hassle free.|Lumosity: Brain Training|3.0

2021-11-11 23:17:14-07:00|Worked well until it froze in mid-2021 and can’t get it to work at all! There’s an ‘N’ at the horizon and no planets show at all. No response from the developer.|SkyView® Lite|1.0

2022-03-02 18:09:57-07:00|My daughter, husband and I have subscribed to this for almost two years now. It would be really nice if you could just play games just to improve or for fun but this is not an option. Also sometimes the results bear no resemblance to the performance, you can lose several points or gain several points for no apparent reason. I’ve lost points in areas when there were no games in that area on a particular day. Today I lost in three areas where I really was as good as normal. Yep frustrating ……|Peak - Brain Training|4.0
2022-03-01 13:45:43-07:00|Although “Peak” steadily — at times frustratingly — challenges my quite damaged brain (via a life-altering C19 battle in late Fall, 2020), it’s that very fact which I appreciate, and am so grateful for. “Peak” does not lower its standards, nor expectations, at any point. Those standards give me hope.|Peak - Brain Training|5.0
2022-03-01 06:45:58-07:00|I love the game and it’s challenges. Unfortunately, from time to time it has bugs.

2022-02-28 20:24:52-07:00|Just recently got the pro version. The games are much more challenging than the free ones, giving my brain a really great workout. Scoring and comparison systems really keep me wanting to improve my brain score. After 50 days I’m still not bored by the games! And best of all I feel that it really does help sharpening my mind.

2022-02-25 17:04:33-07:00|I understand the app makes money off of advertisements but when I’m unable to close an Ad to play the game and have to constantly quit the app and reopen to try and play the games it seems like poor design and inconsiderate user experience.|Peak - Brain Training|2.0
2022-02-23 06:15:30-07:00|Not only are the ads excessive and long, they require you to engage with them. I have to shut the app down to make it go away because there is no chance that I will engage. There is no mention of making the ads go away, even with purchase.|Peak - Brain Training|1.0
2022-02-21 19:24:50-07:00|The app has a ridiculous amount of ads that take a very long time to pass. Worse yet, they are now including religious focused ads that do not align with my values & beliefs. I would prefer ads I can customize based on my preferences.|Peak - Brain Training|2.0

2022-02-15 09:28:43-07:00|There’s something wrong with the game “jump control”. I understand you’re not supposed to move your fingers while on the pad but it’s saying I’m moving my fingers when I’m not and I believe there’s a weird glitch. Other than that I’ve been using this app for 4 years now and I’ve seen a huge improvement in my memory. I have severe adhd so doing this every morning first thing helps kick start my brain.|Peak - Brain Training|4.0
2022-02-11 16:00:48-07:00|Used to be a GREAT app but now there are just WAY too many ads. You have to watch an ad before you play a game and immediately after a game you have no choice. It’s a bit annoying you just wanna hurry up and see your results.|Peak - Brain Training|2.0

I’ve been obsessed with this game and after four or so years I can just enjoy my favorites. It’s fun to crack through a long time ceiling with a bit of effort.|Peak - Brain Training|5.0
2022-02-01 13:02:49-07:00|I love that this app lets me have a baseline so I can track my progress. Some days my brain isn’t alert enough to dig in & get challenged, so I complete the jigsaw puzzles to try to get my photographic memory back. Will you PLEASE add more puzzle images? I’ve completed all of them a number of times. It would also be great if the white puzzle piece outlines went away at the end so we can see the picture clearly? Also, if they can show which ones have been started or completed it would solve a lot of opening and closing each one to find it. Thanks for being so brilliant and for making this app for us!|Peak - Brain Training|4.0
2022-01-31 00:55:16-07:00|Quick review.  I’ve been playing this at the pro level for a few months now and I enjoy seeing the progress and I feel like it helps me expand my mind and improve the skills that it focuses on which improves how I do my work and interact with others.  I enjoy it enough to have it be one of the first things I do on a daily basis.  It’s actually like a required step in my day.  Which brings me to the star reduction. Today I logged on and I had been somewhere in the 90’s for my playing streak.  Yesterday, I played it as I always do.  Today I opened it and my streak said 0 days.  I thought it was an error and would reset after I did the daily workout (because I’ve opened it before and observed that the interface behaved “differently”, I just assumed that this was a one off thing).  But after I did my workout, it updated the day count to one.  That is a big that seriously frustrates me.  All of the other issues I have with these games have been covered by other reviewers except for the fact that if you name a game Word Fresh Zen and push some of the craziest letter combinations as words, then you had better include the word ZEN as a real word.Thanks.|Peak - Brain Training|4.0

2022-01-29 12:19:40-07:00|I really enjoy this app. I appreciate how it is organized and the freedom it gives me to sometimes indulge in my strengths and other times push myself to spend more time developing areas where I’m weaker. For those reasons, I’d give this app 5 stars. However, I’m really turned off by this recent feature of displaying other players’ achievements and touting their progress. If I want to compete against others, I play a video game. But this new feature is ruining my pleasure in my own achievements. If I want to feel stress that I’m not cutting it, I can go out into the world or watch the Hunger Games or Squid Game. Thinking of dropping the app now that it’s been made less fun.|Peak - Brain Training|3.0

Took all the enjoyment out of playing having to have a public profile. Frankly NO one’s business what games I play, when I play them, and how I am doing.

Most specifically, ""Flame Dodge,"" which is really cute and which I really like,  is pretty difficult for me since my hand is in my way...Not sure if that makes sense.  I seem to also have trouble with, ""Happy River,"" and, ""Jump Control.""  Basically, if it involves coordination, my lefty self has difficulty.  I hope you can use this info.

2022-01-15 06:30:42-07:00|This would be 5 stars if:-there was more randomization of the games, it feels like I play the same 5 or 6 all the time.- they changed the word “multiplier” to “bonus.” Multipliers multiply things and they aren’t multiplying anything, but they are adding bonus points.-my biggest wish is for us to be able to create our own daily workouts that count toward our streaks. As it is I could play 7 games of my choosing and they don’t count towards my streak. - allow us to pause our streaks if we need to. I have a chronic illness so some days I physically cannot play, and it is demoralizing to see a multi-month streak wiped out because I was in the hospital. - add other stats like days played since start, days played out of the last 100/ month/week etc. - make the robot on the Connect Em’ Up game less of a jerk. We know we lost, he doesn’t need to be a jerk about it. I’ve been using Peak for more than a year and it is overall a great product. I obviously think very highly of it, and would be a raving fan if the wishes above were granted.|Peak - Brain Training|4.0
2022-01-13 03:04:20-07:00|Be up front about the cost. $100 app or $35 annually. The ‘free’ version is very little. Ironically a brain training game uses some good ‘brain’ tricks to get you to pay: not being up front about the cost, giving you a ‘test’ to start where you do ok but not great (so practice!), only letting you play once daily (testing your patience for instant gratification - ok I’ll pay!), etc. Disappointed.|Peak - Brain Training|1.0

For free users, all you have is a daily workout which means three short games… that’s it.All of these sort of applications allow you to try out at least limited features for an indefinite amount of time to see whether you like it or not, but it is impossible to logically judge the usefulness of the application itself without paying the subscription.|Peak - Brain Training|2.0
2022-01-05 10:13:42-07:00|I’ll take the ads if I can continue to play for free. They’ve been doing more ads, taking more free games away, and now you can only do your daily workout of like 3 games.

I’ve been performing in the top 98%+ in most games, yet my PBS is still way low at 300. You need to change the algorithm to allow users to have an accurate PBS score with less total play time.EDIT: Will revise review to five stars once you fix this ridiculously frustrating PBS score. I was 99th percentile in every game I played today and lost a ton of PBS score.|Peak - Brain Training|1.0

But I do however have a hard time understanding why almost everyone is doing this dumb scheme where the app is free but then you get into the actual app and are greeted by a prompt ‘suggesting’ you get the premium version. You get access to 3 games… just 3… out of 40. I’ve played all 3 and can say that it’s not enough if you want to better yourself mentally. Sure 40$ a year isn’t too much to ask for. But I don’t see why everyone needs to do THIS in particular. Do ads not exist? Is there no other way to make money off an app? I will find a free app that doesn’t ask me for my money after it’s downloaded. Ciao|Elevate - Brain Training|2.0

2022-02-27 03:28:29-07:00|I am a longtime loyal user. However, despite multiple email exchanges with customer support, the landing page in the app is frozen and remains so. This occurred with the upgrade and remains an issue which makes the game unplayable. I’ve been exchanging emails for about two weeks and I either get more questions “have you tired start and restarting the app, uninstalling, does it work on other devices” after I’ve answered the questions or an apology email that they are delayed in responding due to an overwhelming # of emails. Very disappointing and frustrating. Until this is fixed I would not recommend purchasing.|Elevate - Brain Training|1.0

2022-02-23 12:46:59-07:00|After 5 years of subscribing to Elevate, I cannot recommend the app.I recently decided to protect my connection and my personal data by using one of the top-rated, most reliable, and fastest VPNs available.That’s when my access to the Elevate app stopped working.I wasn’t immediately certain of the issue, but I suspected that it might have something to do with the VPN. So, I sent an email to Elevate customer service. That email went completely unacknowledged and unanswered for nearly 2 weeks.My second request did finally receive a response. By the second exchange following that second request for help, I was asked if I was using a VPN. As soon as I disconnected the VPN, I once again had access to the Elevate app for which I’ve long been a paying subscriber.Unfortunately, Elevate had the audacity to lie and say that it was an issue connected to sufficient speed (insinuating that the VPN slows the connection too much for it to be adequate for the app). How do I know that’s untrue? Because I’m able to use all of my other apps and stream video and music on that exact same connection.That type of response is a direct insult to intelligence itself and promotes distrust just as much as any company blocking a VPN should… that is, IF you care about protecting yourself from personal data mining.There are many options for learning and many apps available.Unfortunately, Elevate does not respect my privacy, does not respond to all customer service requests within a reasonable timeframe, and is not honest about its practices.For myself, I’ve concluded that using this app leaves subscribers vulnerable to data mining and is willingly dishonest about its practices. What a shame.Please protect yourself and your personal data.|Elevate - Brain Training|2.0

2022-02-08 12:25:27-07:00|1) it’s a scam because they don’t assess you properly for each category so you have to start with elementary level proficiency for all categories because they want you to play everyday to “level up” and it takes forever to get to a level that is remotely challenging and helpful.2) Some questions and games are so dumb like what is the point and how is it supposed to help me? Their “wrong” answers are confusing because they write poorly spelled phrases that don’t even make sense because it doesn’t relate to the correct answer. 3) too many games yet so few that are actually helpful. Daily workout routine is a nuisance chore because it contains stupid games that don’t make sense. I hope the creators of the game brush up on their own language skills first before trying to create nonsensical games that falsely claim to help your brain.|Elevate - Brain Training|1.0

2022-03-01 14:47:06-07:00|For the most part, this app is very handy. Recognition is great for plants that are common and have many sample pictures in various stages of growth, different angles, and various lighting conditions. Plants that are less well known have fewer sample pictures and the identification is often incorrect. This is the case for a fair number of California native plants, which are the main species I try to identify. Some species are not even in their database, in which case any identification is guaranteed to be wrong. One suggestion I’d like to make is for the app to offer alternative matches if the situation is ambiguous. I sometimes use Google Lens to get multiple possibilities, which can be helpful when I’m sure PictureThis is wrong.|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|4.0

2022-02-27 14:19:53-07:00|This app has been invaluable and identifying plants around my house and then identifying plants and trees that I would like to purchase for my property. Yeah identification has been 100% accuracy.|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|5.0
2022-02-27 12:12:49-07:00|Good if you aren’t that into plants but I’d you have the app I’m guessing you are. It rarely gets my plants right. I have lots of variety’s of exotics especially Alocasia. They have an extremely limited list of varieties so I’m unable to really use the app and I paid a decent amount for it. (Not using free version) it would be great If they could develop a program to allow for correction when the names are wrong and they could be re-searched and added to the list so when others search they would be created. For a paid up I’m disappointed I had high hopes for it but it’s just missing the mark for me.|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|2.0
2022-02-26 16:13:20-07:00|Simply take a picture and then select to identify- interesting short information about everything from growing conditions, caveats, interesting facts and even poetry involving sameEnjoy!!|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|5.0

2022-02-25 14:55:30-07:00|I really have found this app to be very useful in identifying plants that I like, researching their size and optional colors, and determining their temperature/light requirements. Planning my garden is so much easier now!  Thanks!!!|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|5.0
2022-02-24 19:10:02-07:00|I love this app, it’s been helping me get more into my herbalism .. I use it when I go on hikes & im out in nature & it has helped me to identify a few different herbs that are around me that I can grab up real easy.  Love the information on the plants as well ! I think it would be amazing if we got some type of referall system if one person signs up through your link you get a free x amount of months for each person who signs up that would be beautiful .|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|5.0

Plus, not all purchases have a tag with name & how to care for them.This app does it all! Many heartfelt thanks to the developers!|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|5.0
2022-02-20 12:42:54-07:00|I do like that the free version lets you access a lot of features, including the diagnose feature. The one issue i have with it is it’s not always accurate in identification. It’s given me 6 different identifications on one plant and none of them were right, but for the most part it’s okay there too.|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|4.0
2022-02-20 09:54:31-07:00|I took three different pictures from three different angles of a tree.  Each time it gave a different answer.  How can the same tree be a ash, maple, and oak all at the same time?|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|2.0
2022-02-20 05:39:22-07:00|A waste of money. I regret getting this so do not get this app. It gives the same redundant diagnosis on every plant without any helpful advice on what’s wrong with your plant.|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|1.0
2022-02-19 21:33:43-07:00|I have been trying to cancel this app, but there’s no option for it. So, I contacted it’s customer service and was not very helpful either. I am frustrated with this app. Feels like a scam!!!|PictureThis - Plant Identifier|1.0

2022-02-23 14:27:28-07:00|I’m in 8th grade, mind you, I’m not here to complain, but from my point of view, it is a bit harsh. Most of the problems have four questions. This means if you get ONE wrong, you are already down to 75. As someone who has very ‘strict’ parents, I have to do them over and over and over to get a 100% at times. Stressful. Otherwise, it’s fine.|Khan Academy|3.0

2022-02-19 20:25:01-07:00|This app is great. I waited until I tried this on an iPad to see if the videos were too small to view (like on another device). Nope, perfect on an iPad.  Please speak to your counterparts in the Android platform, too much zooming has to be done for those who can’t afford Apple products. This is a great learning platform for HS & college bound youngsters as well as us older ones still interested in knowledge. I like the video presentations & short quizzes. Great for retaining information being learned.Job well done!|Khan Academy|5.0

2022-02-14 20:01:39-07:00|I think it’s a great choice for any mild level autistic kid like myself to try for a career they would like to be conjoined in (Computer Engineering). They give simplified answers of what you need to know which is great, but if you are organizing your alternative sources with Khan Academy & if you want to see some specific information, then from there it’s your choice.

2022-03-02 22:29:53-07:00|For the past month, the app has continually crashed, erased my auto stash, and hasn’t registered a deposit since Jan 29, even though my bank shows the money being taken out. I’ve deleted and reinstalled it to no avail, and haven’t had a response from customer service. I don’t know what’s going on, but I feel I now have no choice but to empty and delete my account. Too bad, considering I’ve been happily using Stash for several years.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|2.0

2022-03-02 03:03:46-07:00|I’ve been trying to connect my new bank account to Stash as I have switched banks. But since my bank is a local bank Stash makes it very difficult to do. I’ve called and have taken the steps that she said were needed and still am not able to switch my bank account so I have had to cancel my auto stash which was set up.  I am very frustrated at this point.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|2.0
2022-03-01 16:37:17-07:00|Have not use this app in over 3 months and it’s still withdrawing money from my account, does not let you de activate your account (I wonder why..) when you try to it says to contact the agency and when you do they don’t answer and if you do get them to answer they leave you on hold forever, worst investment app I’ve ever used and I know they are not going to reimburse me so my recommendation would be to not get this app.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|1.0
2022-03-01 16:32:55-07:00|Love everything about it. Very easy to use plus investing as I spend Win Win |Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|5.0
2022-03-01 14:09:53-07:00|Great little app for longer term holdings (months-years). Easy to use, simple app without a lot of bells and whistles. Nice in-app advice. The Stash stock parties keeps it a bit playful. This is not an app for short term swing-trading (and definitely not for day-trading). It is NOT a “real-time” broker app and not all equities/commodities/etfs are available, but they have their own funds as well. No real crypto, otc, or ftx trading available- it’s not that kind of app. This app is for learning how to save money while (hopefully) earning interests on your savings via the stock market. I use a brokerage app for swing/day trades and crypto derivatives and keep my long term stocks in Stash.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|5.0
2022-03-01 13:27:27-07:00|Simplistic. Aesthetically pleasing interface. What’s not to love about this app. Be patient.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|5.0

2022-02-28 19:59:14-07:00|Update: it’s been a while and stability is much better. Issue now is same once for a few years now- still many taps to get to seeing your investments in one screen. It’s still a bit misleading and I keep going to the wrong places. I literally only check once every few weeks and while the GUI changes, it still takes too long and more screens with each update to see my investments. Frustrating. The concept is fantastic but the app is flawed. It takes way too many clicks to get to the center of the Tootsie pop of your stocks. What makes it worse is when you can’t even see your stocks because the app crashes and screen freezes. Love you only need $5 and no fees. That’s really amazing. Don’t love that not all Stocks are available. 2/5 stars.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|2.0

2022-02-28 17:28:02-07:00|My question for the developers is why do I have scammers copying my business page and messaging everyone of my followers sending them a link to your app? I don’t know if you’re scamming my followers to boost your app or you hired scammers to promote your business but I do not appreciate it and it needs to stop immediately|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|1.0

2022-02-28 14:59:43-07:00|I had first invested through a promotion and was impressed with the app, features, accessibility, along with information and guidance for personal investment goals. I ran into an error the first few weeks where two deductions were made from the Stash system on my account, and a paper came in the mail to inform me my mailbox was full and not receiving mail when it was? So i called C/S: my email was verified and the deductions reversed. One week later, I had a notice to re-connect a bank account, and was offered a $30 promo to do it. First of all, I saw my checking account was still connected, but I made multiple attempts to connect with other accounts with Plaid and manually, to no success, and ultimately I had thought it was a temporary issue, I checked website status, everything was running according to the website. I gave it a couple days, then I had a notice that I needed to reconnect a checking account by midnight to get a now increased promotion of $40. I went at the account connecting process again and was given a message to contact Stash customer service. When I called, I spent nearly 20 minutes with a C/S Rep that was friendly enough but had no idea of the situation with which I presented, nor a hint of what was going on. I just hung up. I don't have time for a broken system that would not only require me to invest money but my time as well. I hope the bugs get ironed out and that this review will be helpful.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|3.0

All I did was transfer money to two separate external accounts. This is ludicrous and I filed a complaint with the FDIC. They referred me to the Federal Reserve. So if this happens file a complaint with the Federal Reserve. They can with hold my money like this.|Stash: Invest & Build Wealth|1.0

So i really like how PBS makes fun shows for toddlers (i do have a problem with that but we will discuss that later) i really enjoyed this when i was young, however, as i got older the shows got old. Please add shows for 5-6 and 7-8. I would appreciate it. Please fix this! I do appreciate its good for toddlers. This app should be fun for everyone, not just for toddlers, if this isn’t the real PBS company, at least add your own shows. Please! But yes your app is nice.|PBS KIDS Video|3.0

2022-02-20 18:16:04-07:00|So I’m Latine and want my kids to grow up speaking Spanish so I watch a lot of cartoons in Spanish on Disney+ or Netflix. We still use the PBS Kids app a lot and even donate to PBS cause my kids love Daniel Tiger, Alma’s Way, Molly of Denali, Pinkalicious, Clifford, basically everything on PBS. But like, I can’t get the app to stream in Spanish most of the time? I pick the language but the audio won’t actually change. And even if it does work and I try to cast it to my Chromecast it just changes back to English and I can’t change the language anymore which is a huge disappointment. Would love for my kids to watch these shows in Spanish! Overall I love the content but the app does need some attention.|PBS KIDS Video|4.0

2022-02-18 10:24:23-07:00|Want to watch a new episode? Too bad. The app starts at the beginning of its list every time you open it. You need to continuously skip to find the new episode. And they’re not even in order. This is especially true for Mr. Rogers. And if you skip too quickly, it just resets at the beginning again. It’s nice to have a selection, but come on... saving your progress through a series is pretty basic now.|PBS KIDS Video|2.0

2022-02-11 09:40:37-07:00|"I was soooo mad when WordGirl stopped airing on our local PBS station—that was my favorite PBS Kids show! Other PBS stations in our area still do air WordGirl, but it's on at 7:30 AM and I hate getting up early, even to watch my favorite show. I would end up dozing off in the middle of the show and missing the whole thing! Luckily, though, I've got the PBS Kids Video app, so I can watch WordGirl whenever I want, although I wish there were more episodes available. I understand that you can only have so many episodes in the app at a time, but it would be nice if there were more episodes available, especially since we need a way to keep kids entertained during the coronavirus pandemic, and even little kids can get bored of the same few episodes over and over. Also, it would be nice if I had the option to ""favorite"" certain shows so that I could find them more easily, like in older versions of the app. It's also cool that this app comes with the PBS Kids sticker pack, but WordGirl stickers would make it even better! And what if you could pick out a custom skin themed to your favorite PBS Kids show? I'll bet the video player would look totally awesome with a WordGirl background! My only real complaints with this app are:1. My iPad is WiFi-only, so I can't use this app where I have no access to WiFi. I know that some shows have downloadable episodes that you can watch offline, but it would be nice if you could add downloadable episodes of WordGirl and Arthur. 2. I see that you are working on improving the captions for older episodes of Arthur, but some of them could still use some improvement. I'm not deaf but I like to read the captions, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would continue to fix them so that they appeared at the right time and matched what the characters were actually saying. 3. I wish there were a way to disable automatic downloads. It's really frustrating having to delete a bunch of unwanted videos.Other than that, this app rocks!"|PBS KIDS Video|5.0

2022-02-07 16:12:52-07:00|How anyone could give this less than five stars beyond me. The content is unbelievable, and it’s FREE! Like really free. Like as in no ads, no banners, no pop-ups. There is literally nothing to purchase ever, and no way your child could accidentally wrack up charges like literally just about every other kids app that exists. All the content is completely wholesome. You will never, ever have to worry about what your kids are watching. The only people who are giving this low ratings are doing so for odd reasons like they can’t get it to cast properly to other devices,  or it’s closing out the app when a phone call comes in, etc.  All things that they could fix if they understood the settings on their devices. These are not issues caused by the app itself. Overall, I can’t imagine a more perfect app for kids.|PBS KIDS Video|5.0

At this level sometimes I can’t even imagine what one or two words are.  I leave the game and come back later and finish the level.  When I complete levels I am very happy with myself.I recently had an occurrence where suddenly over 6,000 of my hints suddenly vanished.  I asked for HELP and days later they were restored.  Thank you to the game makers for reacting so positively; I was very impressed.I like this game so much that if it ever got so hard it was no longer fun, I would start all over.

2022-03-02 17:52:40-07:00|This app is very glitchy. I’m using it on my iPhone 12 with most up to date iOS. The issue with this app is that whenever I go into another app and come back to Rosetta Stone, it’ll glitch and log me out. When I try to log back in, it’ll give me an error and will tell me to try again later. This significantly hinders my ability to use the app and learn the language. The microphone also glitches out from time to time and I have to restart the app for it to work again. This won’t be as much of a problem if the former issue did not exist. But the log out glitch happens so frequently to the point that I fear it will log me out every time I either lock my phone or jump to another app/home page. Please fix this.

2022-02-25 10:38:29-07:00|Update: they suggested lowering the vocal accuracy criteria to fix the issue.  That did not work. Now they want me to buy headphones to use even though nothing is wrong with the microphone in my phone.  Go with another language learning application there are so many more options.  I wish there was a rating below 1 star.The oral lessons where you are supposed to respond will hinder you because there are tons of bugs with the softwares ability to access the microphone. As a result you will fail lessons or have to start the lessons over by force closing the applications and relaunching. Just to assure you all that it is not my phones microphone, my iPhone is about 5 months old, all of audio dictation and home controls are done by voice successfully as well as good audio quality in my phone.

2022-02-25 06:13:08-07:00|Rosetta stone is a good resource for language learning but lacks some needed instruction in the Japanese course. I already had learned the two alphabets and about 50 kanji when I started this course. I think the beginning needs to focus more on learning the kana, or at least provide resources for learning them. Conjugation is also somewhat unclear. I understand the objective is to teach through immersion but there it’s just not enough to simulate immersion and needs a little direction sometimes.The course is great for listening comprehension but could probably be a bit more polished. If you are starting Japanese, I would recommend using DuoLingo before this. Clear the first unit, then come to Rosetta stone as DuoLingo helps learn vocab and grammar, and Rosetta Stone helps listening and speaking.|Rosetta Stone: Learn Languages|4.0

2022-02-24 14:15:34-07:00|Although I am only in the beginning stages of my learning I do like the fact that this app teaches you pronunciation, grammar and so on. I do think that they should teach whether Japanese has syllables or not because as an native English speaker I find it difficult to transition how things are supposed to be said in this language. Especially since I want my pronunciation to be the best that it can be. But overall I truly enjoy using this app for my language learning experience.|Rosetta Stone: Learn Languages|5.0

2022-02-23 12:03:45-07:00|Ponyta303: The Speech Recognition feature is astonishing! The lessons are twice as better than on Duolingo, and before long, I became a master at speech! However, there are some terrible things; On day 7, I downloaded the audio lesson, then when it didn’t work after I clicked it, I went onto a different lesson- only when halfway through it, THEN the audio lesson decided to work and ask me questions. So I went to THAT Downloaded lesson and… It stopped working! So then I went BACK to the OTHER lesson I was working on then… IT WENT ON AGAIN! So here I am now, writing a review while working on the audio lesson. ARG!!! Also, the translator is quite trashy! Often I don’t know a word, open the translator and use it… and it DOESN’T WORK. ARG. Then when I try to stop using it, it DOESN’T WORK. Then I either end up pausing the lesson or while trying to stop using the translator click the wrong answer. All I’m trying to say is… Duolingo is better!|Rosetta Stone: Learn Languages|3.0

HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL JUST BY A PHOTO????? TELL MEEEEE!!! *ahem* Anyways….on to the second thing. I don’t really appreciate how it doesn’t TEACH you, but rather TESTS you…like, if you want to know what something means you have to look really closely at the picture or click the ‘translate’ button. So yeah. That’s about it. K bye now|Rosetta Stone: Learn Languages|4.0
2022-02-19 07:11:31-07:00|The voice recognition when used side by side with the google translate app is noticeably poor. The google translate app understands what I am saying and picks up 100% of my speech.

2022-02-15 13:47:46-07:00|For the cost of Rosetta Stone, the app should not be so buggy to the point it has become unusable. Audio is not playing, speech recognition doesn’t work. The app has to be force closed and reopened to advance from one lesson to the next. Overall, it is incredibly disappointing given the allegedly great reputation Rosetta Stone has had for so long.|Rosetta Stone: Learn Languages|1.0

2022-02-15 10:09:34-07:00|It’s pretty good, but there’s app glitches such as the audio not playing all the way when you do a mic part.

2022-02-13 07:38:28-07:00|The app seems to be a little buggy, and could use some polishing. Sometimes the UI seems like the screen is too small. (iOS and iPadOS) A big gripe is that when advancing, auto advance works best, but sometimes cuts off the audio if I’m trying to listen to a sentence again. (iPadOS) On MAC, there’s a ‘Next’ button, but you can’t use it. You have to click and drag, this is a pain. Would be nice to have support for a Dark Mode, but that’s not topping my list. Would also like to see support for more languages (Czech being my most requested) Alternatively, the Plans are a really nice touch. After one week, I’m getting concepts laid down for me to start forming my own sentences. I also use Duolingo, but I find my retention is much higher with Rosetta Stone.

I will say there is one particular question that is a trick question actually it’s not trick they need to reevaluate the answers the question asks “which animal is active at night?” Two of the options are lion and bat. However, when I selected lion I got it wrong. I know that bats are active at night but so are lions. I am a discovery channel, NatGeo fan therefore I know my info about lions. They are nocturnal hunters and sleep during the day…|Trivia Star: Trivia Games Quiz|5.0

2022-02-23 17:37:40-07:00|Have played for months and was ranking at about 180 of all players overall today. Had 630030 stars. Tonight the game completely froze up on me and wouldn’t do anything. I uninstalled and reinstalled figuring it would be like any other app where you need to do this and it restores your account to where it was. No! I’m back at square one having to start all over again. I think I’m about ready to just get rid of it completely now. I also noticed that once I installed this app months ago that the same annoying game app ads that are on here, started appearing on a few other of my apps that had never had ads before. So, I would say it’s inserting ad ware in some of your other apps too. Just not worth the trouble and waste of time.And for the people saying that the questions start out way too easy and either complaining about it or wondering how people, like me, that made it up into the level hundreds and kept going…it’s because those easy questions get way more difficult and the number of questions per level increases to 9. It’s extremely disappointing to have worked my way up that high only to have had the app freeze and try a reinstall only to have my progress and entire history wiped clean.?|Trivia Star: Trivia Games Quiz|1.0

2022-03-02 16:29:04-07:00|I love this game it’s a really good game I’ve been playing for a while but there’s a problem with a character creator I make a bunch of characters and then only one of them shows up I really spent a lot of time working on those characters I wanna know what’s wrong and also I have some idea I want to go to other friends worlds maybe you could be like an online game that you could go to like other friends world and stuff and like chat with them or stuff also I’m thinking about like a hello Kitty world since you’ve added that pack with like things from hello kitty and like restaurants like that maybe sometimes you can add like a pack that gives you like a bunch of different kinds of plants because I really like the plants and it would fit good in a home lastly maybe add some more like home because like I think we need more!

2022-03-02 15:01:52-07:00|I love this game, I’ve been playing since 2019, but there is some things you HAVE to fix. First of all, sometimes there is invisible things in the way so I can’t place something down(in build mode)Also, the app will kick me app and go to my Home Screen, and will delete whatever I was doing. Another thing related to that is it has kicked me out of the app and deleted EVERYTHING, like resetting the world. I made an amazing house and loved it, and right as I finished it kicked me out of the app and when I went back in ALL my progress was gone, that really made me angry since I’ve spent so much time and money on the game, if it’s just gonna keep doing this I’ll want my money back. Thank you for reading.|Toca Life World: Build stories|4.0
2022-03-02 14:59:47-07:00|Dear Toca,I absolutely love this app! I have played it since it came out. I loved it from the first time I saw it on Toca Mix. Before Toca World, I bought all the Toca Life apps, so I really liked how you linked the apps so I didn’t have to buy them again. Recently my mom bought me all the add ons! I was so excited I played it all day. Also, here are some suggestions: first I would really like an animal shelter. In front it would have a little bit of yard, like the stable,  and a storage bin with dog food bags and inside there will be a front desk. Then there will be eight to ten kennels that any animal can fit in, even Megasloth. Each one will have a food bowl and some will have a dog bone. Then scroll to the right a little more and there will be a yard. It will have an outdoor litter box, like you did at the vet, and poop bags. Then more to the right there will be a cute pet themed cottage. There will be a mom and a kid. They will have a beautiful big dog. Also there will be one guy that works there at the front desk. Another idea is a forest. I know you already have one, but this is a different one. It starts with a thick forest and a trail. There can be a hiker of you want. Then the forest gets thinner. And as you scroll it will go up a hill and then to a cave with a wolf pack in it.  There will be six wolves. Two grey ones, one black and one white.  Then two pups that can be any color. In the forest there is a sleepy owl. And a couple fawns. Now some ideas for Foople Houses: a cat lady’s house. An old house. It will have some wallpapers with cats, and one with flowers and cat scratches on it. It will have cat apartments and a silver litter box. Also mouse toys and a bunch of cat themed stuff. Then a trailer (not includes in cat lady’s house) it will be inside, then a little yard. The door will be in the back of the trailer that opens and closes like the Modern Mansion. Next idea, Foople Pet Creator. It will have the shapes of all existing pets, and update for very new pet like Foople Character Creator. It will have accessories like hats pets can wear, collars. Then any coloring you want, like Foople Houses it can have that color chart, but with more browns blacks and grays. And also the patterning. Like that movie star cat’s pattern on that waitress dog at the Pet Cafè. Also eyes. The eyes of Zeke’s cat on the dog guiding the blind boy at the Harvest Festival. Choosing the eyes, colors, collars, shape and fur (grumpy cat at Pet Hotel with axolotl puppy body) can make a pink and blue corgi with movie cat’s ribbon and a docked tail with the unicorn horn. I think it would be cool if there was a free pack and the pack would be themed all WolfWalkers. If you don’t know what a WolfWalker is it’s a movie. Watch it on Apple TV. Thank you for reading this and I love your apps! I give |Toca Life World: Build stories|5.0

Ok, but now the games I won are done being reviewed and I still can’t get my money…. (Previous update) Update of my review-Game has went to one day a week and it doesn’t let you cash out your winnings. I have played it for years and frankly I’m not playing anymore. Why play when you can’t really win? My previous review is as follows, so you can see they’ve had the same issues before. Took my stars from 3 to 1… My big complaint is it always says games you have won are under review so you can’t cash out. Apparently you can’t cash out if you win once a week like I do. Fix it!

2021-03-20 12:40:41-07:00|Normally this game, with its simplistic play and nonsensical unfoldings and continuity errors that disappoint like no other, would quickly be panned, deleted, and fastly be removed from memory. But when I came to live in a Salvation Army homeless shelter for 3 months to be finally away from and out of the reaches of my abuser ex boyfriend, having only $0.74 cents to my name, a traumatized mind full of panic attacks from 2 years of his attempts on my life, emotional and physical abuse on another level, and gut wrenching Stockholm syndrome loneliness hollowing out my insides each night.... this free game, which I download off my $29 Alcatel smartphone I’d somehow managed to buy after he threw my iPhone away in a dumpster, was one of the only things helping me heal, cure boredom, and helped take my mind off of the 30 other men swarming around my bed each night in our one big open bunk room, where they spontaneously broke out in fights and would constantly trigger me and exacerbate my anxieties. I felt incarcerated, in my mind , my life, and state of absolute hopelessness at that time: this level of game was what I normally would never have even considered playing; but through it, I felt heard, like someone else understood the painful truth of just how long it would probably take to get through and heal from this wound’s lifetime sentencing... and this dumb game’s simplicity was seriously about all that my badly broken mind would handle at the time. And for this, this game will forever have a soft spot in my since broken, but still-beating heart. |Words Story|4.0

2021-01-03 00:37:00-07:00|I just got the game today when I was scrolling through the App Store and thought it looked pretty cool... I started playing and it all went well until I decided to make a purchase. I bought the least expensive one, because it was already getting boring and I hadn’t even been playing for 10 minutes. Well I bought the coins and when I clicked out of the store to go back to the game I discovered that my coins weren’t there! I thought maybe it just has to load in, so I left the level and joined back in. To my surprise it STILL wasn’t there. I left the app, rejoined, and looked at my coins... still 25... I then went to the store to see if I could get some sort of refund, but I couldn’t find anything. I’m 100% sure this game doesn’t deserve 5 stars, but you and I both know that if I gave it anything less, you would have to scroll a long ways down to find this... and people barely even bother to look at the comments, let alone scroll down to find them. I suggest not getting this game, it will waste your time, and it’s not as fun as it looks. It’s also all a huge scam, and I better get my $12.99 back... anyways, I’m sorry if this doesn’t help, but I tried...|Words Story|5.0

Also the free version is only 2 hours a week? That isn’t very fair especially because you lock all the good books anyway so only giving us two hours free for the whole week is a little excessive and you should at least unlock a few more books that aren’t just made mostly by epic. I also use the I survived books for some of my informational essays and I can’t do research with those books at home because they are locked. Kids would use epic all the time you should give them a better option for that and include it in your school account.

I sent several messages but the problems were never resolved. I’m trying a tournament again today — and it seems you are not giving compounded points for streaks, although the cloudy edge appears while I find “acceptable” words and disappears when I find one not in your dictionary. What’s up? I’m in first place and would like to continue, but earning only 25-30 points per game is frustrating. Especially when you show multiple ads.

2022-01-12 08:00:22-07:00|I have played this game for years and loved it. You used to run an ad after every few game plays but now it is every single time. In addition, the ads have gotten longer and harder to get out of. I now have to click several times on the screen while they go through a series of phases. This is pure greed on your part. Extra ads mean extra money in your pocket. Look,  I understand the need for ads and I am willing to tolerate them but only to a point. There is a tipping point at which the annoyance outweighs the fun. And please don’t tell me I can get rid of the ads. I know I can - by paying for the game, which I am not able to do. So instead I will find a different game to play. One with a reasonable amount of ads. P. S. - you might want to rethink this excessive use of ads.

This game isn’t focused on that. It really wants you to create the words in the crossword puzzle. I get credit for the extra words but I feel like I also get penalized because I didn’t focus on the specific words in the puzzle. The motions you use to spell the words are choppy.

2021-07-23 09:39:30-07:00|Changing my original review from 3 stars to 1 since my last review seems to have mysteriously disappeared...I guess the developers are too cowardly to accept legitimate criticism so they removed it. So basically what I said in my last review is that the “lucky” spin wheel is completely rigged. No matter when you hit “stop” it stops wherever it wants to. That’s NOT “luck”. It’s a predetermined outcome. And to claim so is actually wrong. It’s nothing but a deception. You would think a game about words would define it more appropriately. Why am I bothered by this you ask? Because obviously they’re more worried about getting people to spend money buying coins than they are making the game fair, which is actually terrible. They’re just making it seem like you have the chance to win a bunch of coins but the most you’ll ever win is like 100 and that’s not much. They constantly badger you to spend money on buying coins too.

2022-02-25 19:48:27-07:00|Hello!I searched up apps that will help you speak spanish and this was the first result. I had seen the app before, so I downloaded it and instantly fell in love with it. The app is overall amazing and neatly organized. There’s just one issue. Every lesson after lesson one costs money.I’m only a kid, and don’t have money to pay for this app. I was so upset because I really wanted to learn Spanish and reinforce what I was learning in school. My whole family speaks it and I was eager to learn. I began the first lesson and things went great! I already knew some of the things but it had been fine. Once I finished the lesson I tried to move onto the next one but it had been locked. I was so upset about this. In my opinion the app should be accessible for everyone, whether you have money or not. I think that the lessons should be free, and you would pay for other advanced lessons that would reinforce what they would learn in the normal FREE lessons. Of course though, this is just my opinion and I feel like it would make the app a lot better. I also appreciate that there are no ads, but that may be the cause of why every lesson costs money. This is why overall I would rate this app a 2/5. I just wish the lessons didn’t cost money, but for now I’ll just have to download another app.|Babbel - Language Learning|2.0

I spent 6 years learning Spanish and used it throughout South/Central America and Spain. I wanted to learn Portuguese using Babbel and it’s been an incredibly frustrating experience. I got 6 months for a discount and it still wasn’t worth my money. If you really want to learn a language, there’s simply no substitute for taking a class. If Babbel would have at least started me off with the basics first, I likely would have finished the course. I spent over a month fighting through their terrible course before I gave up.

You should have an option to pick up where you left up… Method used by Babbel in my opinion is very good overall, but I prefer Rosetta Stone still. They need to enhance the speaking part of the process, vocabulary is thrown at you in many sizes and shapes sometimes too fast to digest. Images should be displayed on a bigger size and clearer.

2022-02-22 18:19:34-07:00|I have purchased the Spanish course and it is very disappointing. The selection is miniscule, especially if you are not a complete beginner. And with the few lessons they do have, one of my biggest issues is the voice recognition/pronunciation feature. It doesn’t seem to actually check your pronunciation, but whether you are using the tone and inflection of whatever character they have you mimicking. So even if you say something with perfect accent, if the character dragged a word and you just said it, they will count it as wrong. On one question because the character said bienvenida as bienvendaaaaaaa (for some reason dragging the end), it kept marking me wrong until I pressed continue, heard the voice actor and then understood they wanted me to drag the a. No it wasn’t an issue of the sentence being bienvenida a ____. It was a dragged a at the end. So things like that leave much to be desired, especially when other apps seem to be able to do voice recognition just fine. I won’t be renewing my subscription|Babbel - Language Learning|3.0

I bought a years subscription up front for about $100 for 1 year. I had been taking the German lessons for about a month when I decided I wanted to switch my language lessons to Spanish as I had booked a vacation in the Dominican Republic in about 3 months & the native language there is Spanish. But when I changed my language to Spanish on the Babbel app, I was able to take 1 lesson and then it prompted me to buy another subscription in order to continue my lessons in Spanish!!!!! I’m very bummed that they’d have the nerve to charge another subscription for a new language. I’m better off using Duolingo which is free and can proceed to different levels for free as long as you don’t make too many mistakes or you can practice everyday as your “hearts” will reset. I have been able to practice on Duolingo for free in German and Spanish! I only subscribed to Babbel because of all the stars it received! Maybe that was misleading? Such a Shame.|Babbel - Language Learning|1.0
2022-02-20 20:34:30-07:00|I’ve used a lot of language learning apps and I must say, this one’s the BEST! It includes longer phrases and conversations, short fill-in-the-blanks, and you can choose the type of review you want to focus on (speaking, listening, writing). I also like that it places you at various levels based on real-world situations (Can you watch a TV series or have a political conversation in the language you are learning). The lifetime option is a great deal! |Babbel - Language Learning|5.0

2021-09-03 13:49:10-07:00|I’ve been an avid watcher of TED for many years, shifting over to the app when it was released and very happy with it for years on my original iPad and later this iPad Air.  That lasted until the last time I updated the app, which was some time ago and not recently.  Things changed right away, barely working in some ways, but there was a lot of comment about it at the time and I believed that whatever the underlying causes were could be quickly identified and corrected, so I just waited for the update that would fix it.  So far.....just crickets.The same app works great on my (much) newer iPhone, and running the site through browsers on the iPad works just fine too.  On using the app, however, any or all of the following are routinely encountered:• failure to load at all, or might eventually if you can stand watching the little electron field thingy for 5+ minutes• no access to on screen controls at all or, if they work on the first talk watched, usually go away on the second one • often the only way to quit any talk and move on is to force  quit the app and start over• often locked in to the “next recommended” loop and, again, the only way out is force quitting.• other times, first talk ends and the screen goes blank and dead; force quit is the only way out of that as well.And others, but you get the point by now.  I have no memory or network speed issues at all and the software is updated to the max level it can be — this app and this machine just don’t play well together.  I’d be happy to go back to the older app if that’s the only way  to recover the convenience and functionality that I had back in the day, but getting a new iPad, which I’m  confident would also do the trick, seems like a third-best idea|TED|2.0
2021-09-02 21:21:02-07:00|How does one screw up a video app so badly? This one fails to register taps for minutes at a time, so that it becomes impossible to start and stop videos; if you let it go to full screen, the controls vanish entirely and won’t come back; the talk you wanted to pause drones on and on until you force quit the program. Or sometimes it will stop out of nowhere, having finally realized that you touched the screen two minutes earlier. Bizarre and nearly unusable.|TED|1.0

One thing I hate, and it makes me scream curse words at this app, is the search section. I will literally put in the exact name of the TED talk I want to find, and it will tell me that there is nothing under that search. I have to go to my web browser, type in the TED talk name, and then open the link that takes me to that talk in the app. You guys are a multi billion dollar organization.

And why only 3 lives? Gets kinda annoying. But I recommend this game a lot! Thanks for reading this, Bye! Also, this app takes up SO MUCH STORAGE?!

I know they were correct because I triple-checked and verified them through google, along with other sources.  Today, I experienced such an event and it obviously was motivated by religious discrimination.  For the category Christmas things, I wrote “Jesus Christ”. Now I know Jesus is a man, not a “thing,” but his words and image are found everywhere during this season.  My answer was marked wrong!!!  For those who don’t know it, Christmas originated as a celebration of the birth of Jesus CHRIST.  “The first known use of Christmas, according to Merriam-Webster, was before the 12th century and originates from Middle English’s Christemass, meaning “Christ’s mass.”  I will be passing this on to all my friends and acquaintances to see what they think of a company that denies Jesus is a Christmas thing.

2022-01-11 14:34:25-07:00|Update:  I wrote this review a month ago, and I still have not received any response to my support request.   The issue persisted for several hours on and off, but I never heard back from Flipgrid support.  This was incredibly frustrating and a massive waste of time for my students and me.   Flipgrid has no chat option and no phone number, and now they refuse to respond to support requests placed through their own web form.   What kind of education platform offers zero technical support?   **************************************Flipgrid is normally pretty decent, but it seems to be having an outage or technical issue, and there is no way to speak to Flipgrid support directly. There is no phone number I can call, and no chat support option. All they have is a web form. I filled it out, even though this is extremely time sensitive.  A few hours have passed and they haven’t emailed me back yet. I honestly expected better from Microsoft. It’s finals week, the assignment is due today, and at least a dozen my students have emailed me saying that they are receiving error messages when they try to upload their videos. I cannot even begin to convey how much I regret using Flipgrid right now. It is making my job significantly more difficult than it needs to be. Edited to add: I don’t mind that there’s a technical issue. What I mind is the complete and total lack of customer support. It’s ridiculous that there is no way to call or chat with the help desk.

2022-03-02 19:41:47-07:00|Previously, my school used School Loop for assignments and grades. It was a wonderful app; all of my assignments with their due dates and grades for every class was right there. Heck I could even see on a graph how my grades changes with each assignment. This app? It takes away pretty much all of that. I have to go to each class separately to go looking for assignments. While this may not sound like the worst, as other apps like Google Classroom and Canvas do this, it feels like a major down grade compared to just having everything on one page.Also, unlike Google Classroom and Canvas, Schoology has their grades pushed out of the way. Instead of just being listed where I can see my classes or even, at the very least, when I enter a class, I have to go, click on “grades,” then click each class individually just to look at my grade. I haven’t checked my grade in ages simply because of how out of the way/annoying it is.It is also a pain to see what assignments I have missing.Also I would like to mention that Schoology has deleted the grades/assignments of everyone at my school TWICE. Apparently it’s because when everyone else in our district starts their school year (my school starts a couple of weeks earlier), the entire system from the district get reset to zero. Schools in the same district should not be tied together on this app/website in this way because of incidents like this. I have the feeling that when we end our school year, the grades of everyone else in other schools who end later will get wiped away. This causes unnecessary stress, especially for the teacher who have to deal with it. Many teachers are also not very tech savvy, making this worse.|Schoology|1.0

2022-02-25 20:11:32-07:00|So my school uses schoolboy for class and at this point the entire district uses it. Schoology isn't good for a few reasons: 1. It crashes a ton and has a ton of bugs. When I use Schoology there is always a glitch with the documents where the formatting is incorrect. Another thing, grades don't automatically appear you have to refresh to see them. 2. Horrible UI, when I use Schoology it has a horrid UI and looks disgusting. At least make the front page better looking. 3. Overdue assignments. I turned on notifications for email and phone but I get no overdue notifications or your assignment is due. Overall, Google Classroom is better because it is organized, has a nice UI, and rarely has any bugs or glitches. In my opinion, Schoology shouldn't have been a stable release but only a beta/alpha version. I hope this helped you decide if you want to use Schoology or not!|Schoology|1.0

2022-02-18 10:06:48-07:00|This platform has everything you need and is the best online school platform you can get. It can be overwhelming at first glance, but once you learn how to use it (which won’t take long), it becomes and easily accessible, simple, and organized platform to use.Yo little kids, stop rating it 1 star. Its not like if schoology gets deleted school will magically disappear or you won’t have to do work anymore. Deleting this app can and will cause a crisis in the grading system and you will most likely fail all classes.|Schoology|5.0

2022-02-17 15:32:09-07:00|i personally think that this is a very un useful app but i agree that it is very bad because 1. u should get a reminder that says this is almost overdue instead of notifications saying ur teacher updates (bla bla bla) 2. you could also use google classrooms for free but schoology u must pay to have a account. 3. the website is always crashing no matter what we’ve all at least 3 times had to deal with laggy schoology app 4. when u open a assessment and hit my document it is very small i don’t evan know if i’m typing the right key and i can’t see what the question is asking.|Schoology|1.0

2022-03-02 15:30:52-07:00|I was Super excited to finally learn how to play piano. I got on the app and learned my first 3 notes. It was super fun and easy and I loved it.But then it was forcing me to go premium which costs money. And I don’t have  the money to spend on the app. In the beginning it acts like it’s a free app but then wouldn’t let you go on without paying money. It’s a good app but making you pay before you can move on. Plus it was so frustrating  When the app makes ads it doesn’t say it costs money which is unfair for people(like me) that don’t have the money. It makes you think it’s free but not. I really wanted to learn with simply piano but i guess I’ll just do in real life lessons|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|2.0
2022-03-02 14:38:40-07:00|Ok so in all the SimplyPiano addsIt says this app is free so I downloaded it then when I learned my three notes I HAVE TO PAYYYY that’s un fair please make it free pleassssse|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|3.0

2022-03-02 06:20:34-07:00|This app deserves more than five stars. I make beats, and started out on a 6 track Yamaha psr 270 and transitioned to using a DAW over ten years ago with that time I’ve lost the essence of playing the keys. I want my music to sound more professional and complex so I’ve decided to learn the basics of playing piano to be able create unique Melodie’s and chords and this app is a great tool to help me accomplish that goal. Thank you and I’ll become premium customer soon!|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|5.0
2022-03-01 19:51:06-07:00|I’ve always wanted to learn piano, and one day I was watching YouTube and BOOM! I saw SimplyPiano it’s such a amazing app so highly recremended! I was kind of advanced already, but this app taught me sooooooo much more! Say goodbye to pricey piano lessons and welcome to the best piano app ever!!!|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|5.0
2022-03-01 18:25:43-07:00|This app helped me in many ways. Learning notes and the sounds were like stairs, just before I was there, the premium subscription showed up. In my opinion, I think the prices are way too high. Maybe you should consider lowering the prices a bit. It would help us out a lot.|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|3.0
2022-03-01 16:58:18-07:00|Everyone agrees EXECPT the creators THAT you shouldn’t have to pay to do more songs! I downloaded this app a couple of years ago (maybe 2) and had so much fun! What I didn’t realize is that my mom and dad had to get a premium pass for me, WHICH IS PROBABLY NOT FREE! We shouldn’t have to pay to play song, it is NOT FAIR. Business is great and all 2 STARS|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|2.0
2022-03-01 16:50:39-07:00|At first I thought it was a good idea The app so I asked my mom to buy Premium and after two days I was basically a right hand pro but after a month I decided to play the piano again but then it asked me to log back and do you premium so I asked my mom to sign for me but then when my mom went to sign in it said I already bought premium so make sure to memorize all the songsBut it doesn’t really turn you into a piano Pro like the adds say don’t buy this app it’s a psycho|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|1.0

2022-03-01 16:20:14-07:00|So I got a keyboard for Christmas and I was really excited to play it. When I found out about this app I very happy. The bad part is for me it delays the keys and sometimes doesn’t even count them and says I didn’t play them. This get’s me really frustrated and disappointed. So please fix this bug and besides that the game has thought me a lot. I can now read notes, play chords, and a lot more. So please fix this bug and good job!|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|4.0

2022-03-01 11:13:15-07:00|I rated the app 3 stars because you need to pay more then 100 dollars! And I was like come on! And some people can’t afford it just to play piano! My dad can afford it but it’s too much! Just for 7 days it’s free then you have to pay! Don’t want to be rude but I’m a 7 year old writing this review sooo yeah. My mom is going to come back from her vacation and get me a piano so I might not use this app to learn piano. That’s it for this review, bye! |Simply Piano by JoyTunes|3.0

2022-03-01 08:12:29-07:00|I have used for about 15 months. I have learned how to play using this program. Except for timing- you will have no idea where or why you are off time because this program probably doesn’t want to pay for the patent on showing why your off time. Other programs show when and where you are off time. This program is not for serious learners. I probably would have learned more and earlier if I could have searched discussions. I have unsubscribed and will continue to use for my remaining subscription. I will not continue to support something that I pay for that I can’t access one of the most important aspects of learning- the discussions. I am certain I can find another piano app that doesn’t require me to access Facebook for features I paid . Even more egregious is the developer response that I should just email them questions. That is exactly the problem- I paid your fee to learn piano and one of the features of learning is to access all of the discussions- but the developer wants me to join Facebook or just email them questions? That is not the same learning experience as paying a developer that actually provides a complete learning experience free of Facebook or with the ability to learn from others by reading through the discussions.|Simply Piano by JoyTunes|1.0

I loved it so much that I even saved up for a keyboard at my dads house so I could practice more.

2022-03-01 13:45:14-07:00|It is like playing guitar hero but with a real guitar and the real actual notes and chords. I am so impressed. It cannot have been easy to make this so perfect. I have not been able to stop since I started and I am an absolute beginner. The pace of learning is perfect because it has been just like a game with a tutorial for each level and I have been playing songs (modified to my level) since the very first lesson so you don’t get bored with all the initial learning and no fun of playing a song! One of a kind learning experience. Exceeded expectations. |Yousician: Your Music Teacher|5.0

2022-02-20 09:51:05-07:00|THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER!!  YOU ARE NOT TEACHING PEOPLE TO PLAY GUITAR, YOU ARE TEACHING THEM NOT TO PLAY GUITAR I WAS JUST DOING ONE OF THE FIRST LEVELS WITH THE OPEN STRING PRACTICE AND I WAS PLAYING THE 6 STRING AND IT SAID NO NO NO NO U R SO ANNOYING AND THIS APP IS DUMB|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|1.0
2022-02-19 13:57:33-07:00|THIS APP IS AMAZING AAAAA WONDERFUL!!! Developers thank you so much for making something that is actually FREE (except for the time limit and some song that I can’t play for free, but I can live with that )!! I can actually do chords and play songs now! I play piano, violin, and flute, and people around me are like, “You should play the guitar “, and I’m like, “I don’t know how it looks really hard and my mom won’t get me a teacher !” But I love the guitar and am determined to play it, so I downloaded SimplyGuitar. HORRIBLE. Not free AT ALL except for a few useless messages. Then, I downloaded Yousician. Now, just 2 weeks in, I can play chords, songs, and I actually know the names of the strings!  Thank you sososososoSO much developers for making this game!!  Edit: Just a few reccomendations, the full version is a bit pricey. I mean, $139.99/year after the free trial us a bit much. I really want the full version, but my mom won’t get it for me because it’s too expensive. Maybe lower the prices a bit? And another thing, after learning chords, instead of jumping right into a song with a bunch of chords plus the new one(s), maybe add some slow practices with the chord(s) that you just taught? It would make it a lot easier. And last, instead of having to wait a full day to go to another lesson, exercise, game, or song, maybe have a cooldown where you have to wait 1 or 2 hours before you can play again. Just a few ideas to make your app even better (which is hard, because it already is so good ), thanks if you add them to your wonderful app, and have a great day! |Yousician: Your Music Teacher|5.0
2022-02-18 16:58:05-07:00|I just bought a guitar for the first time and I had no idea how to play it until I got this app. This app is really great!|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|5.0

2022-02-15 16:08:52-07:00|I decided to learn guitar in lockdown and tried many apps and online courses. Yousician was the one that stuck and I enjoy my premium membership enormously. With no formal music theory knowledge, and having never held a guitar before, the app got me up and running quickly, and soon playing recognizable songs. I find the gamification fun, though I’m sure that purists will complain that this is no way to learn an instrument as the “right” way is to play scales until your fingers bleed, but I find the contrived and humorous little practice songs to be much more enjoyable. I’m making great progress and the frequent addition of new famous songs, will keep me subscribing for a long time to come. Main benefits of this app over competition:Superior note/chord recognition and feedback.Selection of famous songs.Multiple ways to use the app (structured lessons, by topic, or dabble).Quality instructional videos complemented by practice, evaluation and songs.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|5.0

2022-02-11 14:54:13-07:00|The app itself doesn’t have a lot of the tabs right for songs and also the ability for the app to distinguish the correct notes is very off. I’ve played songs correctly off this app while going through it and it still doesn’t pick up the notes and says they’re wrong even though they’re the exact notes/chords on the screen.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|2.0

2022-02-08 16:50:36-07:00|I don’t really recommend this app. I’ve app been trying to play the Em chord but for some reason it doesn’t go through. And yes I’m playing the right chord cause I let my friend, who actually plays guitar, and it still doesn’t go through. Wish I could get my many back|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|1.0
2022-02-08 15:09:25-07:00|Great app made me amazing at bass but… To use any song u need a trial and they are way to expensive and I can’t even use anything|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|2.0
2022-02-08 11:54:39-07:00|I already know how to read music but only have used thumb and index finger before when not playing chords.  I want to learn finger style and this looks very promising for me, only a week into it but so far it is helping a lot|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|4.0
2022-02-08 08:58:47-07:00|I think it’s crazy how much money you have to pay to get to play you get some free lessons but only 30min a day and to get more time you have to pay a ridicules amount to play your favorite song otherwise you can only play the songs that they choose for you but besides the money it’s a great app really good teaching.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|3.0
2022-02-08 08:46:33-07:00|I have been using Yousician for about a month now utilizing the Voice and Bass Guitar program. I already play bass but figured this would be a great resource for practice. I must say, my singing has improved significantly since starting the program. My only criticism would be that the lessons utilize songs written by the developers and therefore, in order to progress, you have to learn a song that you’re not familiar with. I understand as why as the use of owned material leads to property issues, royalties, etc.. It’s a minor criticism, but the only one worth mentioning. You WILL learn from this program. You WILL improve using this program. I intend to do the guitar and piano program down the road as well. These programs provide a solid foundation for beginner and development and skill honing for the seasoned musician as well. Worth the money.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|4.0
2022-02-07 16:02:48-07:00|I wish you would make more of the basic lesson free just so we get a little more experience for those who don’t want to pay|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|5.0

2022-02-01 21:08:33-07:00|I am just having a blast learning and improving my guitar playing skills as well as playing my favorite jams. I really enjoy how it teaches you the language of music at the end of the chapters with games incorporated. I play my guitar daily and don't put it down for hours because i have so much fun with this app. Take it from me its worth every penny.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|5.0
2022-02-01 19:12:06-07:00|First, it’s so costly. Second, there is a lack of good songs. There are no good songs, just lots of songs by Yousician themselves. Third, it’s very glitchy. It’s always telling me there’s too much background noise even though it’s silent. I even did a test where I didn’t play and it was dead silent and it still told me there was too much background noise. Also, it would always tell me there are dead notes even though I would play the chord perfectly. And when I would do chord trainer I would randomly only play string 1 once and it showed that string 2, 3, and 6 were all being played? Lastly, the chords it would pick out to play for a song wouldn’t match up with the song at all. And one more thing, some chords were impossible to play because it’s literally physically impossible to bend and squeeze my fingers into one little spot for a chord without there always being a dead note. The  “A”chord is a good example.But how it’s formatted for songs, color coded, numbered frets, and the little white ball arching to get your timing right is really awesome. It’s not the worst app to learn to play guitar, you will get the hang of it eventually with this but there are definitely better apps to learn faster and easier.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|3.0
2022-01-31 10:55:42-07:00|Ok so I’ve been playing guitar for years, but really just learning chords to songs I liked etc. The past year I’ve been working on technique a bit more, and started using the free version of Yousician along with several other apps. This past week I finally upgraded to the full version since I got tired of being limited to 30 minutes a day, and since it’s cold and snowy out I have more time to play. I have to say, I’m finding this really useful, even to the point where I’ve gone back to the lower levels now that I’m not limited on time. Even though I’ve played for years, there are some fundamentals that I never learned “properly” and I have found it helpful to start with the basics again, even if a lot of the lower levels are too simplistic for me. The one thing that impresses me is how the lessons really build on each other and integrate skills that were learned earlier, which really makes it worthwhile to work through it in order. I also really appreciate how the app will take a particular song and chop it up, teaching chord change techniques and maybe later revisiting the same song for something like picking style or arpeggios. Especially with the team’s original songs, they can really be deconstructed and learned from multiple angles, such as chords and rhythm, leads, and even different ways of playing the chords to the same song “cowboy vs fancy chords” is what they call it. The only negative to me is now that I’m playing more and using the app for longer periods of time, I get a little “car sick” from the IPad sitting in front of me and the songs constantly scrolling by from right to left. If I sit there for a long period of time, when I look away there’s definitely a bit of motion sickness going on. But I’m honestly not sure how that could be fixed, unless maybe the notes came down the neck towards you, like guitar hero?|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|5.0
2022-01-29 17:36:21-07:00|I created my account like 5-6 years ago and this was the only way I enjoyed learning to play guitar. Made it feel like a game and it was fun. Have you like 20 min every day of you did t subscribe tho the monthly subscription. I’ve gotten busy with my life and finally picked up my guitar after not touching it for almost a whole year. Now you can’t even use the app without subscribing to a 20$ a month subscription. Everything is locked until you play. I’d give 4 more stars for the ability to sit down and play for 20 min and practice a little bit before life calls me away.|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|1.0
2022-01-29 15:06:56-07:00|Before I learned anything the tuner said I was playing the wrong string, string 5, and I was playing string sixSo I skipped it. And on the first song, it still said that I was playing string 5|Yousician: Your Music Teacher|1.0

2022-02-21 16:40:22-07:00|"Update (21/2/2022): The online Night Sky documentation doesn't provide specific uninstallation instructions for macOS. Deleted Night Sky X, and associated widget files. Found no Night Sky preferences files in the macOS Library folders. (Remaining on macOS Big Sur for now, due to macOS Monterey's persisting memory leak issues.)Reinstalled Night Sky X from the Mac App Store.Upon first and subsequent launches, was immediately able to reproduce issue of being unable to successfully exit the first two sub-menus of Settings (My Sky Notifications & Preferences) without quitting the application.Using ""Clear Night Sky Cache"" abruptly dumps one into the My Sky Notifications sub-menu — and again, unable to exit it.(Was able to successfully turn off the Stargazing Music in Preferences. Was _still_ unable to add any additional Night Sky notifications.)Interestingly, found no iCloud storage being used by Night Sky, before or after reinstall (!).On macOS, the user interface for changing the time and date of the sky view display is opaque, ackward, painful, and doesn't follow good user interface practices.The ""Night Sky For You"" widget would benefit from a serious re-think in terms of layout and content.But, why not add in Night Sky X screen saver(s) for macOS? Seriously, that could be a great additional feature at some point.Anyway, sorry guys, honestly, -1 star.[macOS Monterey 12.2.1, MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)]Update (17/2/2022): Plus 1 star for the prompt and useful reply from the developer.I gratefully acknowledge that the developer has reported attempting to reproduce the issues I've noted experiencing here with Night Sky X, since it was freshly installed last year on macOS Big Sur on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), and that their attempt was reportedly unsuccessful.The active user base of Night Sky X on macOS is apparently small enough that there are insuffiient Mac App Store reviews of any sort in recent months to judge the extent to which my experience here may be an outlier.On this device, macOS, and all other apps, are functioninging nominally. Except as previously noted, restarting the Mac has not resolved the ongoing issues with Night Sky X. The malfunctions have persisted through multiple updates of both Night Sky X, and macOS. ...[U]nfortunately, this app's malfunctions I've noted on macOS Big Sur from its very first launch, superficially appear more characteristic of poor coding, rather than app or preferences corruption...Previously (14/2/2022): This app has features galore. But, so what?To offer just one egregous example, in macOS (the lastest version of Big Sur, 11.6.3, for instance), Settings > My Sky Notificatons has long been broken in varous ways, and remained broken, despite many app updates.Night Sky's My Sky Notifications are very unreliable (although relaunching the app and/or rebooting the Mac may enable them to resume for a time); and, aside from the defaults, it has never been possible to successfully add additional notifications since we first installed this app on macOS many months ago.Futhermore — and most telling — simply attempting to exit the My Sky Notifications section of settings results in being bounced right back into that section, with the only way to actually leave that section being to quit the application entirely. Again, this issue has remained for many updates. Seriously?!Etc.Unfortunately, even the most basic Quality Assurance testing of this app is clearly absent, at least on macOS.Sadly, I wouldn't trust or rely on anything in this software without verifying it elsewhere. Ambition is great, but attention to detail is clearly lacking.This app has many bells and whistles, and much dazzling eye candy that often seems to impede its use as a basic astronomical tool. The development of this app clearly emphasizes marketing nominal features, at the expense of reliability and basic usability.I wish it were easier to _quickly_ switch user modes, or deactivate some of the extraneous features, with an eye toward clarity of display and improved performance. There are some options for this, but dealing with them seems more of a chore than it needs to be.As an astronomy professional who has worked in science education and software development, I'm continually left with the impression that this is very heavily feature-laden, unreliable, toy software. As paid (and worse, optionally subscription-based) software, I've never actually felt I could justify recommending this app to students or casual amateurs, much less fellow educators and professionals.That said, I've actually gifted this app both to a relative and to a friend, without particular recommendation, because it was conveneient.I originally purchased this app years ago on iOS, on sale, simply to play around with. However, I've rarely bothered with it on iOS, pehaps due to its slow launch time and poor performance on the older devices I've tried it with. (Notably, the same sorts of somewhat older iOS devices many students may have handed down to them by their parents.)As it stands, I can't recommend a subscription to this to anyone.Picking it up on sale, or free? Ok, sure, give it a try.Sincerely, I hope the developer makes the effort to up their game in terms of quality, reliability, usablitiy, and performance. I'm not being paid to test, offer feedback, or review their software. Rather than being worth my personal time and effort, or being written in hope of any actual, fundamental improvement; this review is merely a consequence of finally being sufficiently annoyed by some obvious, ongoing ineptness — which is never a good sign when it comes to software UX.Two stars — because having long-standing, completely broken settings functions is clearly well-below average; and because the app has lots of features someone cared enough to implement, while still enabling the app to actually run for the most part without crashing."|Night Sky|2.0

2022-02-18 08:12:12-07:00|I initially had problems getting it to run on my iPhone 13 mini, but fixed with multiple restarts., thanks to great communications from the developer.   I like this app best because it gives me a great simulated view of the sky as I hold the phone up to the sky and turn in the direction of sky features I wish to know more about… And allows me to merge the actual night sky with the simulation for better identification of planets, stars, and constellations.|Night Sky|5.0

2022-02-14 16:53:34-07:00|I like the app very much but it’s just not sometimes letting me move the screen and I can’t find much constellations plus I kind of think it’s not really scanning the sky it’s just showing us a picture and I don’t think it’s real but I do kind of because this is just a iPad how can it see through our wall.?|Night Sky|4.0
2022-02-14 13:15:03-07:00|Highest-quality review you've seen, right?But yeah, it would be cool if the AR were to be improved though; that tech is going to be vital in the mixed-reality, open metaverse|Night Sky|4.0

2022-02-12 17:01:05-07:00|This game is AWSOME! So worth it there is a tiny glitch though whenever I’m in my house if I put my iPad up to a wall I can see through it so… ya still 5 stars!|Night Sky|5.0
2022-02-12 12:39:43-07:00|I downloaded this app because my three-year old son and I like going outside at night just before his bedtime to play and look at the moon and stars, and I just wanted to be able to tell him which planets and constellations we were seeing. This app did that and so much more. I had no idea what was orbiting our planet! I also love the widget. My son also likes to use the AR feature in the house and sit the sun or the moon in our living room. I haven’t used even half of what the app offers yet and I decided to purchase the lifetime subscription. I wanted the full experience for when I was ready to use it, but mostly I felt that even the free features were worth the price. I did run into an issue where the app was not recognizing that I was Premium. Every time I opened it, it thought I was a free user and then I had to “restore purchase” to get it to work again. I emailed customer service for help and they were super responsive and worked with me to try to figure out what was wrong. The latest update fixed the issue. Overall, we’re thrilled with what this app has to offer - I’m learning so much! - and recommend to anyone looking for a great star gazing app.|Night Sky|5.0

2022-01-26 06:53:49-07:00|I learned so much from this app. It was so accurate. But for the past year it has been off. I can see the moon with my eye and point the camera at it and it’s not in the phone. Scroll off to the side a few inches and a degree or two and there’s the moon. That means everything is off. So now I can’t find the stars I see with my eye on the app. So if you want to learn a ton about the sky this is the map. Just don’t expect to find what you’re looking for anymore.   #Garbage #WasteOfAnExcellentApp|Night Sky|1.0

2022-01-19 16:03:01-07:00|There is way too much going on. It shows every single star and it clutters up the screen and makes it near impossible to find things I actually want to see. Not to mention every, what feels like, 10 seconds a pop up opens asking me to review the app, follow them on twitter. Or if I zoom in too far an ad for the premium version covers the entire screen. I only give this 2 stars because it has lots of information, the problem is the packaging of said information.|Night Sky|2.0

Though there are many differences, this is the best mobile adaptation I’ve found and I really enjoy it. It has its flaws, but nothing major/that actually degrades gameplay AND it isn’t packed to the brim with advertisements which is a rarity for mobile games these days. You get 1 ad for every 10+ mins of gameplay which, again, is so refreshing in comparison to the disgusting overload of cringy and flat out weird advertisements on basically every other game on the App Store.

The second problem is i was playing the steak one and when i was trying to shred the meat none would come out i think its normal or a glitch and i tried so hard to get the meant to come out and i only got 10% of it doneThe  developers if your reading this review please I SAID PLEASE fix this glitch|Cooking Mama: Let's cook!|4.0

If I still had any of my DS’s I wouldn’t have this app period  why can’t y’all be like animal crossing at least they don’t try to endlessly sell you things.

2020-11-30 07:13:44-07:00|EDIT: I have to add that multiple posts with pdf. Attachments are not appearing on the app which absolutely ridiculous and I seriously upset because I have to look through a bunch of posts and then got to the website to find it was always there it’s just not their on my device.Dear Edmodo,Hello I am current a student who uses Edmodo... ( I sound so smart :) )... and I would like for some changes to be made so that this app can be updated to be better for students like me. My suggestions:1. Add a mark as completedI have add many problems with assignments that I have already completed in person or that the teacher made optional for some students that say that I have not completed them and it is very irritating.2. Make an option to sync calendar I would very much appreciate a feature that could sync the Edmodo calendar to the calendar on my phone or computer so I can have all events (not just school work) so that i can properly estimate the amount of time I have and be able to spend it to my advantage.3. Sometimes when the match choices with the corresponding is to large the other answers are at the bottom of the screen and I have to drag it to the bottom to the top or vice versa and it becomes extremely annoying especially when you are on a device with a small screen.4. Attachments aren’t prioritizedWhen a teacher adds a post with an attachment you have to press more to see more text and the attachment(s) so it’s hard to find things especially when your teacher gives homework everyday and almost all have to do with one attachment that I have to find in a whole lot of posts.5. Sometimes it doesn’t show the full thing even if you press more unless you click on the post to make it larger especially when the questions are on the post.Thank you for your concern.Anonymous.|Edmodo: Your Online Classroom|3.0
2020-11-28 14:07:08-07:00|As a student it’s one of the easiest applications/sites there are to communicate with my teachers but pleaaasee bring back the planner future on the website, the calendar is so much more confusing and doesnt tell which assignments are completed and which are not, definitely a wrong choice switching it with the calendar, my suggestion is to being it back and put another option (the calendar) as some people may still want to use it|Edmodo: Your Online Classroom|4.0

I generally don’t recommend anyone use it unless they’re just wanting to check a message. you can do from a computer. Most apps are designed to replicate what you can do from a computer, so I often find myself having to explain to students that they need to access Edmodo via the web on an iPad or on a computer if they want to submit an assignment, etc because the app is pretty much only useful to view messages or look at a grade.

2022-01-16 08:05:30-07:00|Wikipedia made a believer out of me through this app. We know Wikipedia, the noble goals, the power of the people, the smart-quirky hubris of curiosity about all things.  But I didn’t consistently choose Wikipedia for all things until I started using this app. All things ARE here - from 1932 film noir to some Irish electoral act centuries ago, to Japanese Manga and today, singer John Denver. Thank you Wikipedia and Wikipedia Foundation for 20+ years of giving us better living for the people, by the people, with this awesome app.|Wikipedia|5.0
2022-01-12 20:38:15-07:00|You have to create an account to sync your data. I used it for years without doing that until I ran out of phone space and it dumped my app data and saved a backup of that image. Icloud doesn’t work with it at all. I managed to transfer it once while keeping two phones on at the same time. It’s really nice to drop your phone and get a new one, and the experienced is marred by downloading all your apps and find out they all worked fine but losing all your reading list and history from the wiki app. I want to be angry, but when I’m gone from this planet, I hope we relish in the fact that we left the desk messy and with our mind’s eye we could not uphold any memories or evidence of our research. Maybe my research doesn’t matter. Maybe confucius should have advised his disciples to burn all records instead of write them down. You get wikipedia. You figure it out.|Wikipedia|1.0

2022-01-01 21:26:17-07:00|The Wikipedia App isn’t glitchy to the point of annoyance, given the community’s dedication, but there’s enough notable glitches for me to compile a list that hinder my experience, minor or major. - When looking though your lists of saved articles, visual duplicates of the exact same article may appear and are inaccessible yet confusing. - A specific apostrophe (' on my device) result in the app crashing instantly. - Somehow, an article you just pressed the save button to will not be saved immediately, or won’t be put into a specific list. (I have over 300+ articles saved on my device so I don’t know how often this may happen to other users.)My only other suggestion is that visual symbols that appear on the top right of Wikipedia articles that designate said article’s status (like barnstars for featured status, green plus marks for particularly good articles, or colored locks to show the topic’s current potential controversy) appear on mobile devices as well, so as to emphasize the importance and trust in articles that stand out for quality.|Wikipedia|4.0

2021-11-18 09:29:30-07:00|A couple of months ago, Wikipedia wasn’t working for me (wouldn’t open, nothing). So I deleted the app and re-downloaded it. I LOST EVERYTHING! Before it stopped working, I had a Wiki account set up, was logged in, list and article/bookmarks syncing enabled and EVERYTHING else to be able to log in from anywhere and have access to those bookmarked pages and lists I had saved. But after logging in after re-downloading the app, nothing, and I mean NOTHING was saved or synced. No articles/bookmarks, no lists. I had over thirty lists and over 5,000 articles bookmarked.For the past couple of months, I’ve been trying to rebuild my lists and saved articles by memory, but I’m still far from where it originally was.Now I just found out, the lists and articles are STILL NOT SYNCING OR SAVING!!! I logged into my Wiki account from a desktop and guess what, no articles or lists are showing up!! Even when the app says lists and articles will sync in the background when I press “update synced reading lists”. I used this function before the app broke on me and had to re-download, thinking everything would save and sync, but nope! Function is still not working!!Wish the app actually told you if the lists and articles actually got synced and saved. Previous versions of the app did that, but ironically, still nothing saved. Bring back that feature while also actually getting the articles and lists to actually save and sync!What’s the point of an account if NOTHING IS SYNCING OR SAVING!! I might as well just delete the app and use Wiki on my desktop browser and bookmark it in the browser.|Wikipedia|1.0
2021-11-16 17:53:14-07:00|It's been 5 months since the last update for the Wikipedia app and the time to update it is now with new features, different fonts and larger pictures|Wikipedia|5.0

2021-11-01 08:08:21-07:00|Wikipedia is by far the best research tool in all of our social media technology.  I don’t think a day goes by that I am not accessing it.  Even if it is just for the daily history information.  Thank you to all who work so hard to keep it going.|Wikipedia|5.0
2021-10-31 17:53:52-07:00|There is no scroll bar in the app! It’s an incredibly inconvenient design flaw. Especially given the fact that most Wikipedia pages require constant scrolling, it is a shame you can’t use the side bar to navigate easier.|Wikipedia|3.0
2021-10-26 16:45:00-07:00|I have been using Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects more or less since I’ve been an Internet user and continue to be struck by the depth and quality of their endeavors. I continue to pay money to support this organization as I use their services as my first search. The app is wonderful and snappy. Also, there are plenty of reading preference settings for nighttime readers. Offline reading is also a plus.To you volunteers, thank you for the edits. To the creators of the app and website, thank you for the quality code.|Wikipedia|5.0

2021-10-12 19:58:11-07:00|Wikipedia is a great app because you can search up one topic, and it will be there! For example, if you look up Justin Bieber, than it will show all of the facts about him! And if you look up astronauts, it will show all of the facts about astronauts. Wikipedia is a super helpful tool to use to research anything that you are interested in. It is one hundred percent safe for anyone, and it doesn’t have any ads and it never glitches. I recommend you getting this. And thanks to the developer for putting so much effort in making Wikipedia possible.|Wikipedia|5.0
2021-10-03 21:58:54-07:00|How many times have we read that Wikipedia can be “edited by anyone” only to find out that we’ve been blocked and can’t actually edit anything? I think they want you to think anyone can edit Wikipedia but they don’t actually want anyone doing that. Maybe it’s time to stop saying that anyone can edit Wikipedia since it’s clearly not true.|Wikipedia|1.0
2021-09-28 10:32:13-07:00|Since the last iOS update (14.8) Wikipedia crashes every time I go to another app and come back. Why is it reloading? It's the same text focused page I was already on.

My only issue is that I habitually save articles to read later, and since I have downloaded the app, the list is littered with several duplicate links to pages I have saved, most of which the links don’t take you to the page, and instead act like dead buttons. This app is flawless otherwise, but I find it hard to go through my saved list and keep my downloaded content to a minimum when it’s cluttered the way it is. Please fix. Besides that’s, thank you all so much for your hard work of keeping this app so great and Wikipedia in general, an ad-free, extremely educational corner of our inter webs.|Wikipedia|4.0

It feels like almost everyday i have a huge Robles with it in one way where a discussion board post just isn’t loading and I’ve had multiple times where i submitted something closed the app and because this dumb app glitched out, i missed the date and have to send my professor a huge paragraph begging them to let me resubmit it late because this app is so stupid.

2022-02-23 09:58:56-07:00|The app lets you view documents posted by teachers, and can even view them in different formats, but there is no possibility to export them to an app for markup, preventing most users from completing most of their homework. You have to screenshot and oaste them in your markup app. Also, users must MANUALLY log into their institution accounts EVERY time they reopen the app, and the app doesn't offer password-saving. So in the middle of class when you have to download an assignment you have to type fast to make sure you catch up with the teacher. Very inconvenient. Also, any time you open a document, if you attempt to leave the document in any way it FULLY logs you out of the app, requiring users to log in again, and the app does not save any login info. It's just such a tedious app to use and navigate.|Blackboard|1.0

2022-02-17 10:46:17-07:00|If I could give blackboard 0 stars I would. The mobile version of this platform is impossible to use. You can’t see assignments or feedback on the mobile app, and it accidentally “submits” blank assignments when I go to check grades. It’s counterintuitive and the iPad app is the same. We need a mobile app that has the FULL functionality of the webpage. At a previous university I used Canvas and that app, and I truly wish I was still using it at my new school because it is so much better than this.|Blackboard|1.0

To navigate so many assignments over a number of classes would be time consuming when I can simply click the assignment from the notification bar and instantly nip that assignment before its too late.|Blackboard|3.0

2022-02-04 22:20:06-07:00|Blackboard has always been poor but they made it worse somehow. A few years ago you could open the app and you could access your content per usual for a mediocre experience. At some point an update made it to where it automatically logged you out every time you closed the app. Auto fill for passwords does not work, printing me to use my phone passcode to access my saved passwords and fill it in before being able to login. It is legitimately faster to sign in on any browser that is not this application. 0/5 stars with this issue never being resolved, 3/5 stars if it’s fixed.|Blackboard|1.0

2021-03-09 15:18:38-07:00|So if you don’t want to be annoyed with adds dont download this game. I downloaded this because the add made it look interesting soooo like the usual me I download this app. I completed the first level then comes the adds. Then every level I completed, there was always an add!!! Then when I got to level 65, I said in these EXACT WORDS “ Ok I’ve had enough of these like 2 minute adds!” “ These hard levels and stupid offers!” So I deleted it. It is a fun game overall just they need to fix the add thing I hope you understand me. Have a fantastic day or night !|Hello Stars|2.0
2021-03-03 18:34:11-07:00|Overall I LOVE this game but I think there is too much ads as every time I lost there was a Ad and by every level It gets a little bit harder which means there will be more Ads|Hello Stars|4.0

You would launch a water balloon using a teeter totter sort of catapult at a sleeping guys buy drawing the right object. Nope. Game is nothing like that at all. Then each level gives you 24 coins when you get full stars, the less stars less coins. To get new balls and backgrounds are 1000 for the cheapest. I mean, thats just not fun to try at all. And where did the dancer and stage come from? Why is that a part? Plus, the videos for coins and stuff don’t work, and I have good WiFi. Waste of time. Go play something else.|Hello Stars|1.0

2020-11-15 12:35:37-07:00|The game is fine, it’s just that it’s the same ad when we’re watching the ads to get prizes, it’s just the same ad over and over and over and over again, please add more variety of ads to your game, it would be more entertaining and WAY less boring|Hello Stars|3.0

2022-03-01 10:34:25-07:00|The app itself is great and has helped me a lot, but now they are basically forcing me to pay for a subscription because it won’t let me watch any adds and I can’t get the answers anymore. Update on the app, I got the pro version a while ago and it was good (it was 100 as I remember) but then they made a new version which is a tutoring version, which basically took everything from pro and it is 100 dollars to get that one. What was the whole point of having people get the pro if you where just gonna change it?  Here’s a update.

2022-02-23 05:57:30-07:00|The first missing star is missing because I don’t like the fact that when I post a question it gives someone else points from my account. Why can’t they just get points from the system? Just like we receive 5 points for logging on. I think they should get points from the system instead of taking my earned points from my account. The second missing star is missing because I don’t have brain.ly plus (I can’t afford it) and I use this app for my very hard test that I take. After a certain amount of answers, it starts saying that I have to get brain.ly plus and it takes a while until I start getting free answers again. I’m still not happy with it because I have test that I use this app for and I began to fall behind when I can’t get the right answers.|Brainly – Homework Help App|3.0

I’m never using brainly again and I’m disappointed that they became money hungry and made it where they only option you have is to pay for the annual(and they upped the price of that) Bc paying $10 a month is absolutely ridiculous.|Brainly – Homework Help App|1.0

2022-01-19 15:32:16-07:00|I love this app for my kids!  They use it all the time, especially with covid sense we can't go to the library, and they love it too.  Such a life saver when our library closed due to the virus.  Thank you Sora!!!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2022-01-13 19:02:19-07:00|I have no idea why people don’t like this app. As an app that offers hundreds of free ebooks, Im already very satisfied with this download. Love this app, and I don’t see anything wrong with it.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2021-12-20 19:32:05-07:00|Mystic bear is the most popular in a world that has been in t the new one is in a different direction but it will probably take the first to go in a little bit and get the kids out of the car in a few hours|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2021-12-16 10:35:50-07:00|I love this app a lot more than libby, but I wish the audio time adjusted based on how fast the audiobook is sped up.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-12-10 17:04:08-07:00|I love this app I only have one problem when ever I find a book I might like I find out u have the third and not the first or second or the last one which makes it really hard for me to find a book I might like I do think that greatly needs to be fixed I also have an example I am reading the Harry Potter books well u don’t have the last one or wings of fire u have like the first six but that’s it I think it would great if u could go through and download all the books in series u don’t have it would make the app 20 times better|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0
2021-12-09 15:41:05-07:00|I honestly think Sora is a decently good app. Expect what makes me upset is there isn’t much Lgbtqia+ books. I’ve read one and reading another one right now. But there isn’t much of a choose. Sora really needs to add more Lgbtqia+ books. Then I’d give a better review.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-12-02 10:21:09-07:00|It’s fine, but it really seems to be like a knock-off of Libby|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0
2021-11-28 20:52:24-07:00|Pros: Feels authentic Books read from electronics No need to go to the library Audio books Cons: Hold placements: why do you need hold placements on an electronic book app? The book isn’t exactly an object you picked up from the library. It feels like this app could have accomplished so much more is this wasn’t a feature. Electronic books should not have a checkout line. Interface: the interface is glitchy at worst, an annoyance at best. Sampling: when I sample a book I have to return to where I found the book instead of just being able to borrow it right then and there In all, I feel like this app should be an alternative if someone has already borrowed the book you were after in the library, it shouldn’t function as if it were a library itself, at least not with the extreme downsides of the library|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-11-25 18:52:23-07:00|So, I borrowed a book on Sora that I already finished, but wanted to read again. When I scrolled back to the 1st page, it completely froze and I had to restart the app. I did this several times, but it still was not cooperating. Now, whenever I try to go into Sora, the screen is black and doesn’t show me anything. And it’s all because I wanted to reread a book. If I have to go through that every single time, then I’m sure I won’t get on Sora again.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-11-24 15:50:21-07:00|was made for school. automatically bad. i like reading tho so 3 stars|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-11-16 17:49:01-07:00|I like Sora it has a lot of new books that just came out and is good for students but what I hate is that every time I flip a page it would freeze and I would have to refresh a thousand times and it still wouldn’t work. I hope Sora can fix this because I am about to delete this app for its inconvenience.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-11-09 16:59:25-07:00|This app is really amazing, I save a lot of money by getting all my reading done online! I read about 2 books a month so 24 books a year let’s say each book is $10 then I save $240 each year. That’s not even including the extra space I don’t need to clear for books. I also like how you can read on the go, if I’m bored I can just pop out my phone and read. I also like how I have a wide variety of books to choose from. All in all this app is a great place to just read and improve your mood.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2021-11-07 09:39:38-07:00|I like Sora because if I can’t find a book I wanted I can find it on sora.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2021-11-03 15:49:12-07:00|Amazing but I was wondering if there was a way to have a personal account instead of having to have a school or district account made?|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0

2021-10-28 14:32:41-07:00|So glitchy makes reading hard and boring|Sora, by OverDrive Education|1.0
2021-10-24 08:10:55-07:00|I like that this is free, but the app needs work.  Every time I reopen my audiobook it shoots me back to like 5 chapters before and I have to re-find my place.  This can be extremely annoying because when you’re listening you’re not necessarily paying attention to what chapter you’re on.  To those that are complaining about wait lines for ebooks and audiobooks, though, THIS IS HOW THE LIBRARY WORKS and is not an issue with the app.  Libraries buy e-copies of the book but are not allowed to loan out infinite copies.  Otherwise the publishers/authors wouldn’t make any money.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0

2021-10-19 16:17:26-07:00|This app is great for students like me but i want the loans limit to go like up to 15 because the limit now is like doo doo.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-10-17 10:25:30-07:00|This app has such potential but there’s one huge issue… whenever I re-open an audiobook after not listening for a few hours, I find that the app didn’t save where I left off! It always starts me back about 20 minutes from where I really left off so I have to manually fast forward and figure out where to pick back up which is SO frustrating! Definitely not a great user experience. After I finish the book I’m currently listening to in Sora, I’ll be going back to using Overdrive or maybe I’ll try out Libby.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|2.0
2021-10-05 16:51:39-07:00|perfect for reading during class, has excellent selection, easy to use. highly recommend|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0
2021-10-04 20:25:51-07:00|The app will just crash or even freeze at times, so I have to open and close The app. Please fix this Sora.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|1.0
2021-10-04 18:03:04-07:00|It’s good but like I hate returning to this app after awhile and seeing the book I was reading expired. I wish they can eventually add notifications so it’d be easier to know a few days prior so you can either finish it or renew it|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0
2021-09-15 19:10:36-07:00|I am not a fan of reading, but sora got me interested. I use it for school and I love it, but, my old phone (hammy down) can’t support the app. I recommend this game and if it doesn’t work your missing out be I get it. My one suggestion is, maybe somehow make it possible for people with old phones able to get it to work.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0

2021-08-31 06:19:47-07:00|Why do you have to put a hold on a digital book? And when I am reading a book it says I have one day left and I am in two hours then and I have to give it back what is the digital book!|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-08-23 20:01:43-07:00|So, I use this app. Its very good. But, Its hard to find books of your preference. Plus, There should be more challenging books for TD and LI students. Overall, this is a great app that I would recommend for school usage.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0

2021-08-10 18:38:58-07:00|This app is amazing because I don’t need to waste my money on manga but it’s just that we have to wait for the person to return the but anyways this app is still awsome|Sora, by OverDrive Education|4.0
2021-07-26 00:12:38-07:00|This is a pretty great app. But the hold wait is way too long. I tried getting some books to read but the wait is 6 months long. I much rather just go out and buy the book than wait THAT long. And I looked at multiple books and all of them had super long holding time. Possibly the person holding it forgot about the app or the book and has it in their inbox but this is absolutely ridiculous. 6 months?! No thank you. I rather go to my local library to go and borrow the book there.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|3.0
2021-07-25 17:31:47-07:00|Some idiots write bad reviews because of the loan amount, or books it should have. Idiots. The books it has and the loans you can have at the same time depend on the library.|Sora, by OverDrive Education|5.0

In toca hair salon, YOU HAD A SHOWER! Also there is a terrible glitch. One time I was playing, and it exited me out! So I thought: oh, maybe it was connection, but then I tried again, and it was YELLOW! I love hair salons, but this, is a fantasy.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|2.0

2021-01-01 20:06:41-07:00|This game is starting to get boring can you please put something else in it like a snowman and reindeer or something creative and winter instead of a Santa and a tree and it’s because that how why do we have to put the same items on every single thing it’s getting boring I’m starting to not play with this game so you would please change it to something creative in your mind well that would be really helpful and I would probably like this I like this route three years old but now I am eight so now I said just to put something in my sister is getting bored and she’s only six when she was the same age as me and she loved it so can you change it|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0
2020-12-27 14:08:16-07:00|10/10 should NOT download. First, I do not like this game b/c you can’t take the ornaments off of the Christmas tree 2nd of all, it’s very laggy and doesn’t have a good enough quality to be in the App Store.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0
2020-12-23 13:51:15-07:00|So I downloaded this app for fun and the tree and Santa look sad when I make fun of them it’s like they listen to me and fix the background and illustrations . I’m disappointed:(|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|1.0
2020-12-22 14:32:20-07:00|So ٫ I downloaded this app and i saw that is was fun. I played it but there were some glitches. First, when I style them, they sometimes changes faces which is normal but then when I stop, they keep the face that they had. Next, the background moves when I move my device which is a little bit creepy. Maybe because this game is pretty old. Some feedback is that maybe we should have more characters, and more styling things. Other than that, I think this game is pretty fun and perfect for Christmas time! I would give it 3 stars because it needs some changes and bug fixes.|Toca Hair Salon - Christmas|3.0

2022-01-22 14:31:27-07:00|Well, I played this either 2015 or 16 and it was at a friends place, we were having a sleepover, this was all on his Casio commando C771 which is an android phone since we were too poor for iPhones then! Of course I have an iPhone but he still uses android to this day! , his mom gave us permission to use the Wi-Fi and download games and we wanted to find a way to get Minecraft for free but sadly found no way to do it! So we somehow came across exploration lite and me and my friend were fans of DanTDM which was why Minecraft was a big deal to us! So yeah, we downloaded it we played it, of course it wasn’t like how this game is now, it generated allot like Minecraft before the caves and cliffs update! But they were no mobs or animals which I didn’t mind, that night we stayed up till I’m pretty sure past midnight!, but yeah, I liked the game, you could build on it and what not and I even got the game on my old Samsung galaxy legend! Man, this game makes me miss android! Also, creator of the game, if you read this, plz bring back the old version!|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2022-01-09 11:35:57-07:00|i wish this game’s progress would be saved  other than that best game ever since i dnt like multiplayer games|Kiloblocks Lite|5.0
2021-11-25 18:22:24-07:00|A great game! It’s really fun but every time you get off the game everything deletes.  Besides that, great game!|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2021-11-20 05:07:04-07:00|If you do not know the graphics on this game were way different years ago. The graphics were just like Minecraft. It was taken of the App Store for a couple years probably due to copyright or they wanted to make changes. However as soon as I saw the new changes I was disappointed. You can not really save worlds but who cares! Just either record yourself playing the game or just take screenshots to remember your builds. I played this a couple months before I played Minecraft. I mistaken this game as Minecraft cause of all of the similar textures. I remember the first time I played this game just in 2015 which was the same year I played Minecraft. :) The new changes ruined this game a bit but I adjusted to it so it’s ok. I recommend adding more terrain type options for this game. Like add a forest terrain option or something like that. I love this game and I go back and play this game just for the sake of old memories. Do not let the reviews fool you this game is awesome! In 2019 I bought the full version and it was great. Full version is the best. It has so much cool blocks that you can build with. This is nowhere near a ripoff on Minecraft. The developer put hard work and effort into this awesome game. :) I recommend getting the lite version for starters! :D Your customer,Popular333333|Kiloblocks Lite|5.0
2021-11-02 19:18:02-07:00|my sister Benna has this on her tablet, but one thing. can you add animals etc? (i know i have seen a lot of reviews of this)|Kiloblocks Lite|5.0

2021-08-29 16:29:37-07:00|I love this game, I really do. I’ve been playing since I was 6 years old and I’ve always enjoyed it. However, when I was younger I remembered having mountains and hills with lava falls and waterfalls. So I am really hoping you guys would bring it back. It used to be my favorite part of this game. Spawning in places near lakes and ponds, having altitude, making cave houses. It was amazing. So there’s that suggestion that I highly recommend and maybe you can add tutorials on how to build houses or underground hideouts or something like that, I believe it would make the game better. And that allThanks for reading|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2021-08-22 12:03:07-07:00|It deletes all of your hard work, it doesn’t save, so what’s the point of even downloading and playing this anyways? Oh and btw you have to pay for “pro” version just so it could save your world, that’s cruel. Now it would have been better if it was extra blocks you have to pay for.. but no, you have to pay just to save your world. Bad game and wouldn’t recommend.|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2021-08-12 15:03:08-07:00|This version is not bad but the old version is why better|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2021-07-19 12:59:54-07:00|Imagine if you accidentally press the home button or power off button it erased quickly very irritating for those who don’t have full version of this game.|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2021-06-22 15:10:01-07:00|Ok,so, I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews and alot of them are about the saving feature. And all I need is a simple response.ITS A MINECRAFT INSPIRED GAME. SO ITS NOT GONNA BE ALL PERFECT. AND IF YOU GUYS REALLY BUILT AN INTIRE FREAKING CITY, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY EITHER READ THE DESCRIPTION OR MAYBE GET THE FULL GAME. ITS EITHER THAT, TERRIBLE OTHER RIPPOFFS, OR JUST BUY MINECRAFT.Also I like this game but the controls are kinda weird.|Kiloblocks Lite|4.0

Also when I go on the controls it sends me back so could y’all please fix those bugs because at this point people and me are getting really mad and annoyed |Kiloblocks Lite|4.0
2021-04-29 18:28:16-07:00|Now everyone is complaining that the game wont let you save now obviously that  they have not read the description and i specifically says that the paid version lets you load save states ok so stop... please i used to play this game when i was young ok so stop hating on this if anyone is wondering what happened to exploration lite this is the same game just got updated to have a different name|Kiloblocks Lite|5.0
2021-04-22 11:34:30-07:00|After an update it just got boring the previous updates are used to generate a new world like Minecraft but now it's just an RV so now it's just boring and I don't pay that much anymore|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0

2020-11-11 09:52:36-07:00|It was a great game at first but then I built a house that I really worked hard on and my phone accidentally turned off and all my hard work was gone.They really need to fix this because it doesn’t make sense that you put all your hard work into one house or masterpiece and then when your phone accidentally turned off or you accidentally get out of the game it doesn’t save anything.|Kiloblocks Lite|2.0
2020-10-29 04:56:29-07:00|Okay so the concept of the game is great, fun blocks realistic features, but I was building and even just to make a floor it took me a long time because you have to press add and then move. So it would be a great game but it did delete my creation and the tiny thing took me so looooooong to build|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2020-10-09 13:40:13-07:00|Omg I hate this while I was building my house I went to go get a snack for like one minute I cane back to the game when I turned it on everything my hard work was gone gone for good so please whoever made this game please please please change it.|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2020-10-02 18:41:41-07:00|I remember playing this all the time, I was 6 and my brother was 5. We built houses all the time and laughed and jokes around. It was so fun.|Kiloblocks Lite|5.0
2020-09-05 10:49:57-07:00|No. Don’t do that. This game is worse than Minecraft Alpha. I swear, some of the reviews were either bits or the developers if the game. Even Minecraft has said they won’t tolerate people ripping them off. If you’re going to do that, at least put some effort in it.|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0
2020-09-04 09:54:21-07:00|Can you add where you can save the game when you leave it I really like the game but I dont like how I have to lose all of my work|Kiloblocks Lite|5.0
2020-08-27 23:18:52-07:00|Add something to save your progress that is in your world because it’s so annoying to keep making the same thing over and over again ok just at saves|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0

2020-07-15 23:11:23-07:00|I played this game when I was little, but I got rid of it because it couldn’t update, and I couldn’t play it unless I update the game. I’m so happy I found it again!I see a lot of people saying it doesn’t save the game. It’s only a lite version. The final version (Kiloblocks) can save the game, it just costs money.Anyway, this is a great game! Five stars! C:|Kiloblocks Lite|5.0
2020-07-12 11:24:42-07:00|I been playing exploration lite since it was in its first versions. And this is that|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2020-07-09 11:41:09-07:00|I love this game and I have played it since forever! But my only complaint is that even after all these years, you still can not save your progress. Hopefully the app developers will FINALLY take the hint and give us what we want. Please!!|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2020-07-05 20:18:44-07:00|The game is good but when I build something then get off of it I have to start over again and I don’t want to keep doing that over and over again pls fix|Kiloblocks Lite|3.0
2020-07-05 11:34:52-07:00|This game is a sorry excuse of a adventure game This game is like Minecraft but worst there’s no mountains,caves or dungeons You should be ashamed for making this game next time try to be original cuz this looks just like Minecraft but with horrible design|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0

2020-06-27 12:18:09-07:00|This game is fun, I like to play it when there is no WiFi but I like making buildings and all that stuff but when my device dies all my work is gone. Not all of us have money to buy the full version and I know your doing it for money but I really would like to save my work. It’s very annoying as my charger does not work well and when I’m building something my device all of the sudden dies. Please add saving because I really like my builds and I want to keep them. I gave it 1 star because of this annoying thing. Please do not ignore this and add saving oml. A lot of us spend a lot of time on this game when it’s just all going to waste so add. saving. please.|Kiloblocks Lite|1.0

2020-06-11 17:59:43-07:00|If the full version of the game gets to save, why can’t Kiloblocks lite save because what is the point of playing the lite version if it doesn’t save. I mean yeah it is a fun game but I want it to save my work and not everyone has the time and money to buy the full version. So can you please listen to my words and update it or something because I at least want to make different houses while have the ability the go to different worlds.

2022-03-01 07:29:49-07:00|I love this game. You give the monsters food! You can ruin them if you want () by blending them, cooking them in an oven and pot,and much more! This game is the best.Made by ILove|Toca Kitchen Monsters|5.0

2022-02-17 17:56:44-07:00|the original toca kitchen was a big part in my childhood. you could do a lot more with it too.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|2.0
2022-02-04 16:13:35-07:00|So boring and limited food. Like what’s the point of adding broccoli when they don’t even eat it?? You’ve GOTTA do better if you want better reviews.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|2.0
2022-02-02 10:15:02-07:00|This game is good but it gets boring after a while. If there was more food and you could blend stuff together then I would give a 5 star rating but for now it’s 4 stars|Toca Kitchen Monsters|4.0
2022-02-02 09:53:53-07:00|Kinda boring and there's no juice to the game, unlike the other Toca Boca Kitchen games, I want to do the juice.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|3.0
2022-01-30 17:20:07-07:00|Okay, don’t mean to be rude to the people that made this but honestly u are not making this right, why can’t the monsters just EAT! Sorry you need to CHANGE that!|Toca Kitchen Monsters|5.0
2022-01-13 18:08:11-07:00|They have to update the game because it says it was updated “3 years ago” AND THATS A LONG TIME AGO! And there are probably a lot of bugs also I think they did not upgrade the game because it’s old but it’s a good app for kids but the bad part they they did not remove is that they spit at you and it’s not good for kids to spit on something they don’t like, I think they might update the game and make it better for the kids to play and sometimes it KICKED ME OUT THE GAME witch is really annoying but I  think it’s not good or bad for kids to play, also don’t forget to where you masks and wash your hands|Toca Kitchen Monsters|5.0
2022-01-05 11:26:46-07:00|The long neck guy didn’t like my special. Yet the other guy loved it. My special was  1 blended tomato cooked in the microwave then boiled and last grilled but he hated it, even if i put salt and pepper on it. Made me cry.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|2.0
2022-01-03 17:53:26-07:00|There’s only a few things to do and there’s lots of bugs like if one of the monsters opens its mouth for something and then give it something it doesn’t like (brocolli for the blue person) and sometimes his mouth twitches if you give  lots of stuff to him at once then put salt or pepper|Toca Kitchen Monsters|1.0

2021-12-24 19:01:37-07:00|It’s a fun game, but it’s not fun to use the same things over and over and to just have 2 people to cook for. Please make it so that there’s a trash can on the side so I can throw out food because sometimes they don’t like it and they just don’t eat it and then I can’t get rid of it. Also, can you please make it so that the blender actually blends the food into liquid so they can drink too? And if you can, please add more characters  overall, this app is amazing, just need some shaping.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|3.0
2021-12-22 13:02:08-07:00|It really is not the best, It is not as good as the one I used to play…But over all for a free game with not much features, it’s better than having ads all the time! (Like other games not by toca )|Toca Kitchen Monsters|3.0
2021-12-21 12:49:03-07:00|First of all they need to add more monsters and more food because it gets boring after literally like a day and the only reason I downloaded this version is because the regular toca kitchen has to get BOUGHT like I loved toca kitchen but then they made it so you had buy it and could only play this horrible knock off without paying So if you’re downloading this for like a two year old that gets entertained easily then sure download it but I think that it’s not very entertaining.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|1.0
2021-12-14 12:32:01-07:00|It was fun when I first got it but then I started to not like it.When I use a cooking item once and I go to use it again and It will not let me.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|4.0

2021-12-03 17:40:55-07:00|sometimes the monsters dont eat your food, you can just cut it in half and they eat it…but then spit it back out in my face. overall, 10/10, satisfied|Toca Kitchen Monsters|5.0
2021-12-01 19:32:51-07:00|I’m a very young kid it’s easy to entertain me. But this game barely has anything to do. There’s only three monsters secondly there’s only 10 options to use for the fridge for cooking and basically the game is lackluster. It’s only fun for about five minutes before you just get bored and delete it. And I really don’t like having to do bad reviews on games. I don’t understand how Toca Boca but it would be fun to use 10 things in the fridge and serving it to three people that barely have good taste. It’s rude seeing them spitting it out even though it took me 10 minutes to heat up a carrot. I do not recommend you down in this game unless you are TRYING to find a bad game. Toca Boca is lazy games they just keep copying the same game and putting in a different place.|Toca Kitchen Monsters|1.0
2021-11-24 20:29:01-07:00|I would say it is a great game But it does get A bit boring after a Few plays So I have an idea to make it a bit Better So first I think there should be more Options of monsters like there are More People like in the Normal Toca Kitchen And I also think there should be more of a variety Of food Because Like I said In the beginning It gets boring After you feed the monsters All the food and explore with the tools So I believe there should Be more Monsters more Food Options/ Variety of food And I also suggest there should be More of a variety of Tools And appliances To cook with. So yeah Whoever is reading this I hope you have a great day And If you Can Edit the Game Can you Please update The game with some changes Thank you. and have a great day!|Toca Kitchen Monsters|5.0
2021-11-24 18:16:33-07:00|It’s so good and it’s a game for CHILDREN of course it’s going to be boring if you’re 10 years old or + if you like it and you’re older it’s fine i’m 10 and I like it! Play you might like it if not you always can delete it! have a good day|Toca Kitchen Monsters|5.0

So I contacted support and they said they sent in a request to cancel. It never cancelled and I was charged again. I contacted them again and finally got it cancelled with only one month’s refund despite never using the service. Trash company.

2022-01-20 17:33:55-07:00|Hello Games2win so I really like the new update! I like the new update because it has a new city and it’s even better than the old one! And it has gas stations! And you have 139 cars, and I like how you have to drive a 2010 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 when you first start playing the game! My favorite cars is the 2010 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, the Dodge Charger, the Mini Cooper 3 door, the GMC Yukon, the 911 police cars, the Ford Ranger, the designer cars and the Jeep Wrangler! You have many car options and upgrades. You get to unlock and customize your cars the way you like, the options you have are cool paint finishes, neon lights, spoilers, rims, and classic decals! You should add more cars! Add a 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350, a Nissan GT-R Nismo, a GMC Sierra, a Chevrolet Tahoe and a 2020 Ford Mustang GT 5.0! Also I fully completed the academy chapter and I now know to stop at a stop sign or a red light or at a railroad crossing and slow down at a yield sign, and more! You can also enjoy exploring in day and night in the open world (I payed coins for the open world) and explore the city and get coins to unlock new cars and customization! Plus I like the second version (Driving Academy 2: Drive Cars) and it is very fun!  The same thing with Driving Academy UK! Also I purchased the All Cars No Ads! So download this game now and enjoy the customization and stuff! You won’t be disappointed, you will be happy! Please respond to my rating if you are going to add more cars!|Driving Academy 2021 Simulator|5.0

Also, they don’t use directionals so I don’t know where there going so I may hit them. And in this game you have a limited amount of times you can hit a car so it’s not fair at all so please work on that asap. Also there are WAYYYYYY to many adds. That needs to get fixed now.

2022-01-01 14:47:08-07:00|I needs to have Black Friday we’re everything is 50% cheaper And give us jobs please. Also it would be sooooo awesome if you add us getting pulled over by the police if we go over 60 mph.|Driving Academy 2021 Simulator|3.0
2021-12-31 22:33:56-07:00|This app is amazing. When I got it for my daughter I thought that it was probably just another ripoff game. But now I am addicted to it. It is so realistic. And I love that you can choose what you want your car to look like and the color. Thank you!! This game has really helped my daughter get through COVID-19 with something really fun. But… I do think that maybe you could add a map or a GPS so she knows like were to go. Anyway, I am just really thankful for all these amazing, cool, really fun games that you make. (My daughter is hoping for another game like this for Christmas!) My daughter is nine.|Driving Academy 2021 Simulator|5.0
2021-12-31 08:38:11-07:00|I love this game and I love it so much I finished all 100 levels in less than a week. I am way to young to drive a real car but this is definitely preparing me for it. I have one suggestion. You should add rain. I feel like it would add to the realistic perspective. All in all you should get this game!!!!!!|Driving Academy 2021 Simulator|5.0
2021-12-30 12:23:56-07:00|This is a good game but it does not allow you to free drive right away. All and all it’s good.|Driving Academy 2021 Simulator|4.0

2021-12-27 17:38:39-07:00|I think it’s a very fun game, but there’s to many ads I want to have fun but all I see is ads if there where less ads I wouldn’t rage!|Driving Academy 2021 Simulator|3.0

2021-12-24 21:33:56-07:00|Hello!  I like this game a lot but I don’t like how you can only crash six or four times.It is annoying because IT IS CALLED FREE DRIVE. But it is a pretty good game in General.|Driving Academy 2021 Simulator|4.0

2022-02-27 22:13:32-07:00|So it’s really fun but you have to pay to get most of the things you can’t be a princess make nail art dance host pool parties or play in the ocean you only have 2 people and no pets, you less money, and can’t get some stuff, and you can’t make cards. You should really fix the free part. Annoying! But stil fun|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0

2022-02-27 15:25:09-07:00|I had got the app the first time I went to the show the next day I went to the show but it didn't work.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-27 14:50:04-07:00|I am in love with this game it’s just that if I join in the game it keeps asking “Come join in the VIP club!” Even though it is monthly pay so if this game would stop VIP then I will re download this game just stop to much VIP at least that’s the much you guys can do for all you can do for all the kids playing.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0
2022-02-27 08:09:53-07:00|I don’t like that you can’t do very much unless you pay for the VIP club. I don’t like that you can only have two characters.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-27 07:15:27-07:00|This game is worth the VIP fee. Yes, a lot of people complain about it, and it would be better at 4.00$ or 3.99$. But it’s worth it!And my favorite thing is the new update that came out after the new Barbie movie! In all, this is a wonderful game!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-27 05:43:59-07:00|It was a fun game at first but then I kind of got boring. I liked it but it was also a bit bad.I didn’t like having to spend my money every month.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-26 22:17:10-07:00|I loved playing it sense I was 5! But now that I’m 10 I realized that you can only have 3 people at a time and it was so frustrating because in the picture it had more that 3 people in the pool! My question is…. Why?|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-26 20:33:58-07:00|I LOVE THE GAME BUT I WANT ALL THE CHARACTERS I’M TIRED OF ONLY BEING ABLE TO ONLY PLAY WITH TWO CHARACTERS!!!!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-26 11:50:54-07:00|My little sister loves this game! The holiday events and constant additions makes sure she doesn’t tire of it anytime soon!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-26 09:44:14-07:00|My kids love this app! I chose to do VIP because their iPads are connected to my AppleID so I only pay for 1 subscription. However, $7.99 a month seems a bit steep. Turns out there are several options if you go manage your Subscriptions. Why is the annual option not advertised? Also why are there different prices for weekly, monthly, and annual? As a way to support developers? Either way, go check out that annual option if you want this for your kids!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-26 08:59:14-07:00|OK I’m just gonna say I’m afraid of Barbies I download this app because it’s as close to Sims as I can get anyways so are used to be able hear everything and sometimes I heard her say wait but it was too late I already did something and it’s kind of creepy not going to lie and it’s too much stuff like you have to buy that you have to buy that I would really love to play with all the characters for free can you please add that but another case if it’s good also always read the reviews on apps before you download because it can be scary because you don’t know what you’re downloading like you download talking Angela and then you get creeped out or you download a app with so many ads or you download a scam anyways it’s kind of creepy but I suggest but the nail character I forgot her name I think it was her name was Barbie but oh yeah they call her Brooklyn anyways she’s kind of creepy not going to lie and also can you please please please again add the characters for free so we don’t have to pay whiff them thank you and it’s also not like those games that you have so many ads to be honest you still get a bit of ads and I would love some more updates like you can add as like to get more Barbie coins without paying for VIP or make it so you can only Buy VIP for like one thing and you don’t have to pay for again because my mom said I have to pay for it a lot|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-26 07:25:15-07:00|When you play the game. It’s actually really fun. You get to do cool role plays and games! But you only start with two characters and then you need V.I.P for everything else. The only thing you can do is use Nicki and Barbie, which are the first characters you get. I would love the game if there was no V.I.P or only a little. It would be a cool role play game but they want you to pay for everything. |Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-26 07:16:14-07:00|Ok let’s get real 6.99 a month!? I bought this for my 7 yr old cuz and she’s upset: half the things in the Dreamhouse are VIP 6.99 a month is like 84 bucks a year!? Way to expensive|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-26 05:38:00-07:00|Soooooooooooo…. Bad you have to pay for ever thing|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-26 05:01:02-07:00|Hello! I was wondering if we could make all the characters free at least because kids are gonna be askin there parents to buy them vip but it is so fricken expensive!  That just a suggestion but I love everything else!  Thanks for the game!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-25 19:02:45-07:00|I love this game but I absolutely HATE the VIP that needs to change!!!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0

2022-02-25 08:28:02-07:00|I love your game but there’s too much glitches. You need to add more money, room to eat,more rooms and lower prices. You really need to add more places because all we have is the house and places only VIP people can go. Also add more GLITTER and decorations please. And make 3 babies that NEVER grow up. Hopefully you will add some new updates soon oh and I really would appreciate it if you added babies!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0

2022-02-24 12:09:30-07:00|I have had this game for a while and I love it. But there is one thing why do you have to pay so much. At least unlock a few things and characters at the house or make the payment a single payment for the entire time I have it not just for the month or week.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-24 11:03:16-07:00|I love this game sooooo much but there is something’s I was you to make come true Please make the pool open for everyone and the doggies and make all of the place and in the places free I realy realy realy hope the owner of this game is reading cause this is coming from the heart .please please make my wish come truePlease thank you to everyone that’s reading .Have a good dayByeI said byeGOODBYE|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-24 06:48:30-07:00|Its a great game but… allllot of this is VIP, but not everything. It’s kind of weird but their should not be a VIP… and I think that the VIP is real money but I’m not sure. You can’t paint your nails without Vip. It’s quite annoying. Being 10, I’m not going to pay money for an app. The advertisement is kind of wrong, because it does not show the vip. The advertising makes it looks like everything is free. And most of the time,I want to go to the castle but it’s VIP. Most of the fun stuff is Vip.Please change this, so we don’t have to do vip. Thanks :)|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-23 14:42:39-07:00|I love Barbie I always have when I was young and I still do I love Barbie’s Dream house adventure show that I watch on Netflix when I first downloaded this game I was looking forward to it but then it changed, when most of the stuff or new stuff added is VIP and like you can’t buy a lot of stuff either because you get so little amounts of money and I wish some of the other charaters were unlocked to like Ken, Skipper the parents or the puppies. There aren’t a lot of stuff you can do with the activities with the VIP and I can’t get it it’s just to much, I really loved this app I had stopped playing it for awhile because you can barley do anything I understand the VIP and that you need money but for those like me who can’t purchase the VIP monthly it’s just not fair, as like others said this is a kid friendly app, and your excepting kids to get money to pay for it? Pls unlock more features that are free that’s all I’m begging for you to do! Just please for the sakes of others! And ME! I hate games with VIP but this is just ridiculous a kids app, you shouldn’t have to pay monthly for it!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0

2022-02-22 21:45:21-07:00|The game is ok with out vip but it could be better it gets boring when you only have two people and I think there should be another way to be vip that that does not cost REAL MONEY.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-22 07:59:54-07:00|IT DOSEN’T EVEN SAVE I BOUGHT THEM BUT MY SCREEN GLICHED AND NOW I ONLY HAVE ONE COIN I SHOULD HAVE 28 NOT 1|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0

2022-02-21 23:00:52-07:00|Like a lot of the other comments here , I think the VIP is too much. There should be like an update were you get everything with VIP. But a subscription for the daily prize, to get extra of something.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0
2022-02-21 16:57:46-07:00|I like this game but I wish you could just have all the locations free without VIP, and there should be no VIP clothes and VIP character because the game just gets boring with only two characters. Please respond!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|4.0
2022-02-21 14:52:56-07:00|Ok so I thought it would be fun to download it but then It said I didn’t have enough space so I deleted a few games but it still wasn’t enough until I have no game and FINALLY DOWNLOADED AND ITS NOT EVEN FUN|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-21 13:06:49-07:00|This game isn’t a bad game but I think that it’s just to much VIP stuff. Not everyone wants to pay money just to unlock characters and other stuff. Also 6.99 a month is way to expensive especially during Covid time. I think you guys could do better with the game if y’all made more stuff free. Also there’s not a lot of hair options to choose from.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|1.0
2022-02-21 12:03:24-07:00|Horrible game too many VIP things it’s not OK to have that many things children just wanna have fun this game and the parent should not have to pay for the children to have fun! You also removed all of my swimsuits which I absolutely hate! if you do not add more places and make more stuff non-VIP or a free I will delete this app and never recommend it to anybody! I think everybody now knows why are you Vip you just use vip to get more money off the game if you want to get more money off the game you should definitely think about making more places and making it all free!! the game supposed be fun for children and not a money loser!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|2.0
2022-02-21 11:55:09-07:00|It’s a great game! Super fun, BUT $6.99 a month?!?! Why such high prices?! I do think there was too much VIP stuff and to charge me for that even when I’m not using/buying VIP stuff is just RIDICULOUS!|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|3.0
2022-02-21 11:51:00-07:00|i paid for the vip like a long time ago, an then this update comes out where u have to pay more! i was so disappointed and deleted the app. after a year i re-download it and i see that i have access to everything again bc i paid for the vip before! i deleted so many game apps and social media apps just to make space for this app! this app is what keeps me awake till 3am!! love the update thank you!!!!!! <333|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0
2022-02-21 08:07:46-07:00|I’m disappointed you should be ashamed of yourself this game is amazing and there’s no place I need to do is put whatever the number thing is and then it’s free it’s even free how dare you talk about Covid and prices there is no price.|Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures|5.0

2022-02-13 06:12:58-07:00|In the pursuit of learning a new language, there are a number of tools that one should have in their kit, SpanishDict being one of them. It shines in deciphering idioms and synonyms for common words whose meanings vary depending on context. The examples are great as well. This app is not as convenient as some dedicated online translators for full sentences or passages - but it is an excellent tool and I use it nearly every day.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0
2022-02-10 15:01:45-07:00|I really like this app. It’s the best resource I’ve found for learning Spanish. My only gripe is that the technology needs a little more polish. If I’m in the middle of a lesson and I put the app in the background, often when I come back the app closes my lesson and returns to the home page. This can be frustrating particularly when I’m in the middle of a long lesson and I have to stop to answer a text or something. There seems to be no way to save progress. I also find that sometimes the sound on the video lessons cuts out. And the drag and drop lessons freeze up occasionally. Overall these inconveniences are not enough to detract from the enormous value of this app.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|4.0

However, recently this app’s largest apple widget is not showing me all the information. Specifically, the largest widget is supposed to show me the word of the day with two examples of it being used in a sentence. Unfortunately, I have been unable to see the second example for the past couple of weeks.

2021-12-29 10:48:49-07:00|Prior to the latest update, this was my “go to” app for strengthening my Spanish. After the latest update, when I type something to be translated, I am given a “good” translation/estimate of what I’m trying to say, then when I select view more translations everything changes. Even the previous decent translation is gone. Thankfully I've progressed enough to know what I’m trying to say. But if I were still a true beginner…this would frustrate me & possibly turn me away from the app altogether. Maybe its just my phone. But hopefully this gets resolved.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|3.0
2021-12-29 03:59:17-07:00|I’ve been using the free app to help me with my Spanish learning. The translations, examples and pronunciation are most helpful. Especially the “slow syllable by syllable” pronunciation tool. Also quick handy access to conjugations.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0
2021-12-28 05:43:59-07:00|Learning all my words and phrases!im learning at a very good pace! Speaking fully French also helps me in the pronounciation!|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0

2021-12-25 07:48:44-07:00|If you want a good app for beginners to practice Spanish vocabulary, this may do it for you. I’m an advanced learner who simply wants a dictionary, and it’s not at all clear where the basic dictionary function of this app is. The app pops up exercises and vocabulary lists, which are not useful once you are actually speaking the language.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|2.0

2021-12-21 20:23:19-07:00|Since iOS 15 rolled out, I have not been able to open SpanishDict. It’s my favorite app and I’m completely bummed. When I tap on the word of the day which is a widget on my front page, it closes out right away. The same happens when I try to open from the app on my phone. Please fix. I am running the latest update on both.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|1.0
2021-12-20 16:58:33-07:00|Great app to use while learning Spanish! Has quiz’s you can take, gives you full translations of any sentence you type in and will repeat it back to you in Spanish so you see it written and hear it too. Very, very helpful! This app has helped me improve my Spanish reading, writing and verbal exponentially! I am a hands on learner, this app helps me to do just that while I am having real conversations with my Spanish friends. I type in what I want to say and it translates it for me and lets me hear it as well so I can learn to listen to my Spanish speaking friends better and pick out the words they are saying. Most Latin people speak very quickly so ‘listening’ is often challenging. Get it, use it, learn and have fun! Then go travel a lot and make lots of friends so you can practice your Spanish speaking and writing.|SpanishDict Spanish Translator|5.0

This app should be called Google Annoyance and Despair. Now i think i am unrelated to any famous art, and i am worthless. Fix this now, please!!! EDIT: i waited months and you still haven’t fixed it! AAUGH! |Google Arts & Culture|1.0
2021-12-27 07:29:01-07:00|Nothing is wrong with the content itself; but I haven’t even been using the app for more than ten minutes and I would say the overall usability is… strange.For one, there’s no ‘dark’ mode. I study art even while I’m in bed, which makes it important for me to be able to use dark mode as a way to avoid the extra eye strain.Secondly, there’s no way for me to go back to the homepage! I don’t know if this experience is exclusive to the iPad; but you would think that having a back button would be the norm for all apps - especially those produced by one of the largest companies on the internet. When I enter my settings, I don’t see any way to access the homepage. There is no quick access menu anywhere onscreen. Swiping anywhere across the screen to switch back also does not work. I would have to go back to the main page by exiting the app and forcing it to close.I highly recommend the app for the art itself, but the UX needs work. If the app missed having these two basic functions (which could be noticed in minutes) i don’t doubt that the issues stop there.|Google Arts & Culture|2.0

2021-12-16 09:46:35-07:00|I recommend this app for anyone interested in an immersive art experience. There are a lot of tools that allowed you to explore famous artworks, and even a feature that lets you incorporate yourself into a famous piece of art.I had some issues with this app, though. I downloaded it for science class and there was a tool that allowed you to go inside the lungs. It was interesting but very glitchy.Also, some of the features are difficult to understand and sometimes it is hard to find certain features. I give this app a three out of five.|Google Arts & Culture|3.0

Now try to go back. Yep no back button so you have to go back to Home again, click Places, sort by alphabetical...again and scroll ..again. Cmon this is 2021 Some galleries also don’t allow you to zoom in on the artwork. This is especially stupid if the artwork is what looks like to be the size of my iPhone....on my 12.9’ iPad Pro.

I love that you can save favorite articles or pictures. There are so many ways to appreciate art within the app so it can fit any need or style of learning and enjoyment. It’s endless! I feel like I never have enough time to browse but there’s constant information so I don’t feel like I missed out on anything, it just keeps coming. Love it!!|Google Arts & Culture|5.0

2020-08-08 07:09:37-07:00|Great. I only wish I could swipe through my favorites rather than clicking, backing out, and clicking again. Also, it would be nice to have different options for organizing my favorited works—by medium, time period, etc., or even reversing the order— rather than having to always scroll through them from my most recent to the earliest that I favorited; once you gather a decent number, it’s very tedious to navigate them always in the exact same order.|Google Arts & Culture|4.0
2020-07-27 09:59:41-07:00|According to the App Store, this should work on my iPad mini, but it does not. I tried two different experiences: Visiting the leaning tower of Pisa and taking a tour of a park in France. In both cases, the app would constantly hang after the first slide and would state that an error occurred and it was reloading. After a few minutes of this I quit the app and tried starting again, but same result. I also noticed that there are two icons for my account on the upper right and I suspect there should only be one.

2020-05-18 10:07:42-07:00|So appreciative that this app exists. What generosity that Google even created this, to have this accessibility to art without leaving your home. And they way in which they present it isn’t just “here’s some art, look at it”, you can project masterpieces with your phone on to your own wall, get into sometimes hidden detail of what makes Rembrandt a genius, take virtual tours of the Prada! Almost a crime if you don’t use it.|Google Arts & Culture|5.0
2020-05-15 07:03:07-07:00|So broad and comprehensive it is unusable; you might as well use the internet. If you want specificity, like favorite paintings by favorite artists, Pinterest is more functional. The only competitive advantage this has is geographic locations. Let’s say I want to revisit the Louvre, well this works well for museum tours. Hundreds of thousands of items and articles presumes you have infinite time and no plan. If you like to meander endlessly without goal or outcome, other than killing time, than this is for you. If you want to create order and structure out of your artistic preferences and explore undiscovered items similar to what you love, skip this app. I am going to give it another week and then either delete it or revise the review. Let’s see.|Google Arts & Culture|2.0
2020-05-03 22:02:04-07:00|I appreciate the effort but sometimes waiting a little bit longer to release a complete app is better than and early release of a mediocre app.  I hate this thing, I know is free but I have seem better free apps than this thing from Google.

2021-10-12 08:01:03-07:00|This app had a lot of potential but always results in tears for my 3 year old.  The games never respond to touch appropriately and often just refuse to take the correct response.  The new Paw Patrol Halloween Haunted House game plays for about 30 seconds before refusing to accept any responses.  This is incredibly frustrating to both kid and parent.  It’s not a cheap subscription for none of the games to work.  This is an ongoing issue for the year we’ve had the app and none of the updates have addressed it.|Noggin Preschool Learning App|1.0
2021-10-03 18:47:03-07:00|The reason why I put it a four-star is because when I already was putting in the birth year of me which is 2012 it thinks that it’s incorrect and I even tried with older years like 2007 but still no but anyways the game is really useful  and the games are pretty good The shows are also pretty good and it even bring back older shows back from the 90s or from the 2000s and also the game it’s a really good good and all the videos of some of the 2005 to 2008 shows were really Amazing|Noggin Preschool Learning App|4.0

The most annoying of these problems is the fact that the sound will randomly stop out of nowhere. My son will be 10 minutes into a game and the sound goes silent. The only fix is to force close and restart the game from the beginning. At that point my son is frustrated and doesn’t want to play anymore. This needs to be fixed or there will be many people cancelling.|Noggin Preschool Learning App|1.0

2021-07-17 22:16:13-07:00|Noggin has been a great asset for my three year old and he loves to explore the app, themes, complete missions, and various features everyday. I can access content on all our iOS devices, iPhone, iPad, and AppleTV all for only $7.99/ mo. We get monthly progress reports and more to track and continue the learning outside of the platform. To put it into perspective, Noggin has been instrumental during Covid-19 and even now. I love how it has fresh educational content to help your child grow and be happy. I love how the platform offers books (read loud or read to me), sing-a-longs, favorite characters, interactive games, and a wide variety of educational activities to teach and entertain children. My son loves Noggin even more than ABCMouse and he has learned so much more than the average 3 year old. His comprehension level is that of a 5 year old. He has started reading, knows basic addition and subtraction, can tell you how to make different forms of electricity, can spell out words, and so much more. Definitely a game changer in our household.|Noggin Preschool Learning App|5.0

2021-07-15 10:49:13-07:00|This was once a family app with learning. Now most of the fun songs and music videos are gone. Instead of the loving episodes, now there is mostly Halloween and spooky programming. As a Jew, we do not participate in evil “holydays”. It would be better to see the content without agendas. The free Nick app has wayyy more episodes of blues clues in the current season. This app only has a christmas episode of season 2 blues clues and you but had at least 2 more that were removed without notice. Bring actual education programs for preschoolers instead of a ton of empty content to push agendas. Most content on this app is way too fast for preschoolers. Blues clues and sometimes bubble guppies are actually the better parts of the app because it doesn’t so much negatively effect the attention span of the viewers.|Noggin Preschool Learning App|2.0

2021-10-10 11:30:48-07:00|I have used this App on and off for the last 5, almost 6 years. It has proven time and time again to be an awesome resource and tool, and the user interface WAS perfect; very simple to use. I guess this past September (2021) the developers decided to change the App a bit more than the usual bug fixes, which could have been great! Maybe they would make imputing partial derivatives easier, or include some additional resources for particularly difficult problems…. No, they decided to change the awesome interface into some clunky pre smartphone calculator. The interface used to be fairly intuitive, and coming back to the app would only require a minute or so to gain one’s bearings, but now I can hardly figure out where anything is! Why would they do this to long time users—can we at least have the option of using the previous keyboard? Honestly I love this app, it’s gotten me out of some serious binds over the years when my homework got a little too beyond me, or I needed some quick review, but the love has faded. I really hope that I’m the only one who is experiencing this much trouble because I’d love to see Symbolab’s continued use and success, but I’m ready to drop it entirely. I don’t have the heart to give it any less than 4 stars because of all the help it has given me over the years, but I currently do not see it as a five star app. In 8 years of using smart devices, I have never once left a review on the AppStore, but this was the only way I could hope to express how I felt about the situation, and quite frankly the only App I found worth spending the time on. If developers are reading, thanks for taking the time. -Doug|Symbolab Math Problem Solver|4.0

2022-02-12 21:56:10-07:00|I love the game but an ad for another game is between each section. I really can’t take seeing the same things over and over! Any chance of me paying to remove all of the ads ?? Please??|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|5.0
2022-02-12 08:08:28-07:00|Really loved this game when I first started. Would even help grandkids with answers. However when I got further along and couldn’t answer even one more than 2x, decided it was time to leave.  Very disappointed.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|1.0
2022-02-12 06:10:01-07:00|Educational, clever and fun. Graphics amazing and clues are current and also historic. Excellent adventure!|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|5.0
2022-02-11 22:45:10-07:00|Gameplay itself, amazing. The cash grab methods, horrible. Toxic amount of ads. And c’mon, a subscription based word game? $120 A YEAR?! That’s how much you pay for an Amazon membership or streaming service subscription, not a word game lol. Overall, it’s okay for casual players, not so great for the grinders.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|3.0
2022-02-10 19:01:01-07:00|The clues are not everyday answered and requires  look-ups. When checking my questions were already displayed based on others doing the same thing.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|1.0
2022-02-09 15:06:40-07:00|The game is really fun and challenging, lately the though some of the ads and sometimes the game itself will get glitches and would either freeze the game or leave a black screen. It probably just needs an update so I am not worried about it.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|5.0
2022-02-09 03:19:36-07:00|The game is fun and the puzzles are challenging. They have TONS of commercials. They have the long commercials that play after EVERY round. I know they do that to get you to pay for the game but I get so tired of watching so many commercials that I get bored with the game and log off. I think having that many commercials is detrimental to a game. So if you like puzzles and LOVE commercials this is the game for you!|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|2.0
2022-02-05 11:48:37-07:00|It’s been quite a while since new Packs were introduced. I don’t feel I’m quite getting enough for the hefty monthly fee. I really enjoy the app but may have to cancel my sub.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|4.0
2022-01-31 20:57:31-07:00|Nice game but has another app that wont close.  It would be nice if there was a place to attach a screen shot so it could be repaired in a timely fashion.  Always amazes me when the developer doesn't catch the error first!|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|3.0
2022-01-31 07:20:44-07:00|Love this game. I enjoyed playing it and I haven’t found anything quite like it. But every single game is followed by a 30 second ad it is so distracting that I finally deleted it|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|2.0

2022-01-18 07:28:05-07:00|I really like this game. The only reason I took away a star is that I wish there was another way to access the themed puzzles besides a subscription. Either a one time fee or a way to buy over time with in game currency.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|4.0
2022-01-17 20:30:47-07:00|This is a game I pop in and out of occasionally. I enjoy it when I play it, for the most part. It’s the ads. Hands down, it’s the main reason I can’t play for more than a few minutes (or boards) at a time. There’s just too many of them. I don’t mind watching the occasional ad, I get it, the developers have to make money. But it’s constant. And it costs WAY too much to get rid of them. 9.99 A MONTH? Are you kidding? I will happily throw down $2 or $3 for a one time ad removal and then just watch ads to get additional bonus stuff (at my choosing). For now though? I have no desire to spend any actual money on coins or anything with the number of ads I have to sit through. Please reconsider the amount of ads OR have an ad removal option for a reasonable amount of money. EDIT: I know that I can purchase the coin packages that have the “bonus” of ad free for a short period. Guys, that’s not worth it.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|3.0
2022-01-14 23:16:57-07:00|I used to really enjoy playing this game, but don’t like your new version. I realize I can still play part of the old way. It’s slow loading now, and many times I have to try two or three times before I get the game to load, and sometimes doesn’t give me my points after I watch a video for extra points, I watch the video then the game disappears.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|3.0

2022-01-09 17:02:01-07:00|The puzzles are great, but I have a major complaint with one of your advertisers. Entertainment tonight comes on and won’t leave. No X to  tap!  The only way to get back to the game is by turning the iPad off, and restarting.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|2.0

2021-12-27 11:19:10-07:00|I have been playing CodyCross for a couple of years now.  I absolutely love the game, but have come to the end of the puzzles.  Being on a fixed income I can’t afford to “subscribe” to the game, but I don’t understand why it takes so long between adding new puzzles.  It seems like it takes two or three months sometimes before a new level is added, yet your games says “New levels added every Month!”  I don’t know how many people I have encouraged to play this game, I do know I have all my grandkids and one of my sons pretty much addicted to it, but now I don’t see the point.  It was a lot of fun, however now I get tired of checking all the time to see if there is a new level added.  Thanks for the fun you’ve given me in the past.  Hoping you’ll change the process.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|4.0
2021-12-22 10:50:07-07:00|They are CONSTANT. That plus all of these annoyingly flashy themes and immature art style sets me well on my way to finding better puzzle games.No kids are playing this, stop adding “wowie rocket ships” and freaking SPAMMING me with these stupid packs that I literally could not care less about (yes, the intrusive ads are supplemented with even MORE intrusive ads, of which are made and intended to work this way by the developer)It’s best to spend your time elsewhere. After really really trying to like this app, it’s gotta go. I only ever finish a single level and then get frustrated at really obscure words or horrendous advertising. Any time I open this app, it’s a net loss for me.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|2.0
2021-12-13 11:16:34-07:00|Takes 2/3 tries to get out of ads. X the first page out an another different page comes up. Sometimes a third page same ad. I’d pay a couple bucks to stop the ads.|CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles|1.0

2022-02-08 11:32:03-07:00|I love that app. It’s easy for me to study. However I pay monthly for premium.

With the new regulations in place, that was the whole reason for me to have the app. Heavily disappointed that I have to pay for two premium accounts for the same information.

Years ago this app use to be free but it is more than worth the 15 a month especially knowing the questions are the same as the DMV exam.

2022-01-17 19:20:19-07:00|This had been a favorite game. Played two or more puzzles everyday. However, after the update on Jan. 11, 2022, all of my hints are GONE! Yes gone! I had about 103 hints and now I have none. Granted you do not need to use hints for every puzzle but I feel cheated. I successfully solved hundreds of puzzles to accumulate those hints and it isn’t right that they were removed in a snap. Thinking I will delete.

However, it seems that it always starts over on day one, for some reason, and I don’t know why!!! Like I said, I haven’t missed a day, so why would it start over again at day one? It’s just baffling to me!!! Please fix this!!!|WordWhizzle Search|3.0

2021-06-28 14:57:32-07:00|When I downloaded this game I just couldn’t stop playing it. I was ADDICTED. I’m that person who LOVES words and word games so this game was great! But after a while the levels got super hard even for a word nerd like me. So i deleted the game and found myself downloading it a year later. I guess I was just stubborn or whatever but I think it gets a little too hard. Though it’s super fun in the beginning! I like a little challenge but not that much. If your not patient tho, I don’t recommend it. Overall a good game worth downloading!|WordWhizzle Search|4.0

2021-06-10 15:59:48-07:00|WOW!  I’m greatly impressed!  I’m sad to say I never did receive the lost, misplaced, withheld et cetera items, I must admit this game has truly turned a corner.  I’m very seldom disconnected (a HUGE issue for me, mostly occurs in Bingo Blitz) or sent into the black hole many companies send you to when attempting to resolve a game related issue. I’m proud to say this game has captured my attention daily for over the past three months, without A-SINGLE ISSUE!  For me, that’s the highest praise I can offer any company.  I enjoy this as it tests my mind, which ages daily.  I’m now over 60 years young, so we “old folk” look for games such as these.  Trust me, I’ve been around, whether you are young or old, this is enjoyable, relaxing as it tests your knowledge and skills while learning at the same time (should you want to).  I’m very grateful to have my opinion changed from extremely poor (minus zero) to 97%.  I don’t give 100% to anyone/company simply because if they were 100% there is no room for improvement.  ENJOY THIS GAME, you won’t be disappointed!|WordWhizzle Search|5.0

I will delightfully delete this app when summer comes because I hate it with a burning passion :)|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0
2021-04-01 01:08:09-07:00|UPDATE: export function removed. Not good. Can take a screenshot but that’s not the greatest solution.

2021-03-10 11:43:16-07:00|I love Desmos, use it 100% of the time instead of the calculator app that comes with iOS. I really really want a way to hide the graph window, though, so that using it as a regular calculator is easier and takes up the whole screen|Desmos Graphing Calculator|4.0
2021-03-09 17:00:00-07:00|Seriously this is the best app I have ever downloaded on the App Store.  Thank you developers for making such an easy and powerful app. My 8th grader now understands graphing.   You guys are awesome!|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0

2021-02-12 10:40:34-07:00|the calculator is great but the thing i love most about this app is how little storage it takes up. it’s like it’s not even there. i wish developers would focus on this more, since apple started messing with our ability to relieve storage space by transferring files off our several-hundred dollar iphones, pushing us towards paying more for their icloud service instead. thanks for this easy app!|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0
2021-02-07 22:22:40-07:00|Love everything about this app. I’ve used the browser version since middle school and the second I had a smartphone I was using this app. I’ve been using this for years all through getting my ME degree and into my job as an engineer.

2021-01-30 18:33:45-07:00|The floor function is broken, and I’d assume the ceiling function too. Asking for what x makes floor(x)=2, it’ll graph x=3. It probably wants to graph x=2.999999, but something infinitely close to 3 is 3. When doing recursion where the function has to do with floor, I can’t expect it to reliably tell me if the 10th recursion of a fraction multiple of a floor function is going to be the smallest possible value for x.

2020-11-29 12:34:18-07:00|This is less a review, and more a request for a change in features. My dilemma is this:  When entering text in a given calculation bar, it is sometimes necessary to select text to make changes. On the iPhone, this is done by tapping with a finger. Then, to continue the editing process, select the end of the text to continue typing numbers (etc. ). That puts your finger dangerously close to the “X” that will delete all of your work (when all you really wanted was your cursor at the end of the line). Perhaps switching to a “swipe to delete” setup for ridding unwanted calculations would spare those around me an avalanche of dismay?|Desmos Graphing Calculator|3.0
2020-11-12 12:19:19-07:00|Everything about this calculator is wonderful. It’s one the most powerful 2D calculators i’ve seen. The UI is intuitive and easy to use. The only feature i’d recommend is the ability to enter polar equations in more than just r= form.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0

2020-08-20 19:59:41-07:00|I’m a university math student and as such, I’ve had a deep appreciation for Desmos since I downloaded it in high school. The incredible amount of functionality in this app is truly what sets it apart from anything else I’ve ever used. From implicit curves to parametric equations, from multi variable integrals to combinations/permutations. As it is, Desmos registers f(x,y)=g(x,y) as an implicit curve and even r=f(θ) as a polar curve. The one thing that would make this app unstoppable would be the ambitious feat of registering complex numbers. If this is ever accomplished, I think I may die.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0
2020-06-17 11:17:38-07:00|I think Desmos is fantastic, and works so well on the iPad or computer. Just don’t bother using it for an iPhone.

2020-05-09 20:36:40-07:00|I love Desmos. I really do. It’s hard to find a replacement that allows you to graph multiple functions. Right now, as I am preparing for my AP exam, I am so incredibly frustrated that I can’t hold down on the screen to identify a point of interception. In the past, this feature worked without a flaw, and now, I have to zoom very close into the graph to find the intercept myself. Please, amazing desmos engineers, fix this feature! And I will love the app unconditionally once more :)|Desmos Graphing Calculator|2.0
2020-05-07 19:15:59-07:00|This app is amazing, I use it all the time and its pure calculating power along with its saving graphs feature is why I’ve never even thought of deleting it ever.But here’s a small tip for all of you reading this:It may seem that there is no antiderivative feature, but that’s actually wrong. To be fair, you’ve got to know a bit of calculus to know this one, but it’s a simple trick. To get antiderivatives, you’ll need to utilize the first fundamental theorem of calculus, which says:               ₓ∫f(x)dx=∫f(t)dt              ᵃWhere a can be any constant. So if ya need indefinite integrals of functions, use that format. Don’t worry about the value of a. Remember that a +C is added at the end of each antiderivative because it is not needed to calculate regular derivatives.|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0
2020-04-25 05:58:06-07:00|This is a great app. It’s good at doing graphing, it’s good at doing math, and oh boy is it good at entertaining. There are so many equations that look normal and then just go in insane directions. My personal favorites are y = sin(xy) and y = sin(√y**√x**√y)x. The latter gets a bit messy(** means power).|Desmos Graphing Calculator|5.0

2020-02-12 18:38:56-07:00|The app works very well and I am quite satisfied with it, but if it could include an open spot where a function is undefined, that would be nice.

I emailed the customer service they said they added new perks like mythical epic and needed an upgrade (aka more money). I thought I already paid to be a premium member! So I was basically paying for nothing for the past 2 years. Anyways, the quality of the math questions were acceptable, some definitely needs proofreading.

2022-02-11 19:00:06-07:00|First of all this game would be 5 stars but because they lock basic capturing game features like capturing pets (you can only catch a limited number) and evolving them behind a pay wall. Another one I don’t agree with is locking 2/3 of the shop maybe things like changing clothes colors or 1 or 2 articles of clothing I would be fine with. The funny thing is I would gladly pay for it but when you do things like this it makes me feel like I’m being scammed instead of unlocking a few cool things no one else can get. However, if they only had stuff like extra spins or a daily box I’d even go as far as having an island for memberships only. But if I can get something after 30 minutes of killing the mobs and have it be locked because I’m not a VIP it makes me want to uninstall and just quit. There are so many games that do membership systems well but this game is not one of them. I wish people one band together and boycott them but sadly 90% of the members are 7 year olds who want to get ahead of there friends by asking their parents for their credit card.

In my Choral rehearsals, we refer to this app as Mr. Metronome, and my singers get to hear it over a Bluetooth speaker.  They groan when I bring out Mr. Metronome—but they are always better afterwards!Perhaps I’ve missed it, but I would love a feature that would allow me to program in meter changes, as this happens quite a bit in Renaissance vocal music.  Example:  32 measures at 4/4, followed by 8 measures of 3/4, then back to 4.  Its a small issue, really.  I simply adjust the strong beats right now so everything sounds the same when we have mixed meter, but I’d pay for a programmable feature like that.Thanks for a great app!|Pro Metronome - Tempo,Beat,Subdivision,Polyrhythm|5.0

2022-02-05 11:30:20-07:00|Ever since box tops went digital our school is not getting many submissions.|Box Tops for Education™|1.0
2022-02-05 10:24:41-07:00|This is not convenient for me. I have about 7 cereal boxes that I need credit for so I downloaded the app. That’s when I realized that I need my receipt to get credit. I don’t keep my receipts. I hate clutter in my purse and house. So now I would have to remember to scan my receipts before I throw them away. Guarantee I am not going to remember since a lot of my receipts end up in the trash outside the grocery store. So since I can’t clip the box like a coupon, my school is going to miss out on money. Couldn’t you do it like you can still clip them and if people want to they can scan their receipts?  Each box could have their own code so once it’s used, you can’t use it. That way people don’t lie and cheat and try to clip and scan the same. Making the process only one way is not the answer. With COVID and talking to educators about school closures and home schooling through the district the biggest hurdle was families without access to technology and/or internet. Which is why people where able to get free or reduced internet/phone for awhile. Schools were also sending home chrome books just for the times schools were closed. It is really narrow minded to assume everyone is going to be able to have access to technology and internet to use this app or the website and scan their receipt. You can’t easily scan your receipt at the county library either. I think you guys need to go back to the drawing board!|Box Tops for Education™|1.0

2022-02-01 14:52:09-07:00|You have ruined a good thing. No clipping sounds good until one tries to scan a grocery receipt 12 inches long and try to record purchases on the new website. After 3 days and many tries, I was successful in my attempts. I was frustratedAnnoyed and madYou want us to do the work.After all that, I had only 40 cents for our school. The system is not user friendly!!Consider the downside of NO CLIPPING:It cheats the children out of cutting them out, putting them on special “boxtops saving charts”, and proudly bringing in them to school. It eliminates classroom contests (with prizes) for the room collecting the most boxtops in a given month. This system will lose money for the schools Too much hassle.  This is not progressJust more money staying in Big Corporate Pockets because you ARE NOT GIVING TO SCHOOLS|Box Tops for Education™|1.0
2022-02-01 06:01:11-07:00|There are many thing that the app doesn’t recognize.  It’s upsetting because I don’t always get a lot of box top items so when I do I’d like them to be counted.|Box Tops for Education™|3.0

2022-01-27 10:50:46-07:00|The box tops app is fine, but it’s so much more difficult than the tangible box tops. Schools are missing out on actual valuable funding because of this switch. What a shame.|Box Tops for Education™|2.0
2022-01-26 20:19:47-07:00|I understand that with modern age technology going digital is the way to go but you should give customers the option of both ways to collect box tops.  Here's my dilemma, I'm not the one who primarily does the grocery shopping, and then I don't possess the receipt.  They are discarded before I can get my hands on them.  So now 75% of my box top credits are wasted since I can't claim them.|Box Tops for Education™|2.0
2022-01-26 12:57:51-07:00|It is too bad that this program has moved to scan only. I personally enjoy it but our schools are missing out. Grandparents that used to save box tops for their grandchildren are not participating in the program like the younger generation. My mother who has a smart phone doesn’t use the app even though I downloaded it for her and showed her how to use it. This is a bummer.|Box Tops for Education™|3.0
2022-01-25 18:30:06-07:00|Box Tops has made it almost impossible to submit digital box tops from digital receipts. Funny isn’t it? The app in general works ok besides the few bugs here and there. That is…if you have hard copies of your receipts. However, if you have digital receipts for example from a Target pickup order… forget about it! I watched the new video on how to send digital receipts and they still have not made it easier. Not only must you have Box Tops’ email on-hand every time but you can only send them a receipt that was emailed to you from the store. The video says if you do not get the receipts emailed to you you can send it or retrieve it from the stores app (eg Target)… uhm no you can’t. It would be much easier if you could send them screen shots but that is not allowed. Please add a functionality to upload screenshots within your app. This would be a reasonable solution. My box tops earnings have plummeted since digital Box Tops have been implemented… is that by design???|Box Tops for Education™|1.0
2022-01-25 04:51:49-07:00|I feel that this way is the easiest method for parents, caregivers, grandparents to make sure the schools get the box top earnings!

2022-01-20 09:25:30-07:00|I tried for hours yesterday to scan a receipt from Meijer. I had bought five of the products on a list that would earn 30 Box Tops. But due to your poor scanning abilities, I only got credit for 2 Box Tops. Your loss, not mine. You need to make it so I can get credit from the scanning bar at the end of the receipt. Work out a strategy with participating stores that well let you download the receipt from them. The scan bar should make it so that double downloading would not happen. You are losing out on 28 Box Tops from just one receipt. And like me, others will get fed up and just quit trying.|Box Tops for Education™|1.0
2022-01-17 08:58:32-07:00|I’m on the PTO at my daughter’s school & this used to be a fundraiser we could count on. The grade with the most box tops would get a pizza party at the end of the year but since going digital we’ve had to move to other options. The school earns practically nothing since going digital. The reason is probably unique to the individual. Grandparents would help out by clipping box tops but some are less tech savvy & don’t bother with the app. I bet a lot of people like myself just forget to scan the receipt. Not to mention most of the products that carry box tops aren’t very healthy & credit still isn’t being given for some products. I wonder how much of a dip Box Tops is seeing in donations? Total fail.|Box Tops for Education™|1.0

When we had actual box tops we held contests that brought 100’s of box tops. The children loved cutting out the box tops (even when we lost a few from their over zealous cutting). I teach preK and K, they worked on counting and addition and money. Now you have taken that away. From our school all I see is we went from $100.00 a year to $2.00 a year.|Box Tops for Education™|1.0

2022-01-28 12:51:58-07:00|I have been using Skyward to view my grades and register for classes since I began middle school in sixth grade. No other app we use in school has ever come close to being as frustrating and just plain awful to use as skyward. The website already had many problems such as the horrible user interface, freezing randomly, and just flat out not working most of the time, and all of these things unsurprisingly are present on the mobile version as well. This apps user interface is extremely cluttered which makes it annoying to navigate. On top of that, it is very ugly and everything is very small which just makes it inconvenient to click or look at. I wouldn’t mind this too much if the app would actually work when you interacted with it. More than half of the time when you click a button or a drop down it will freeze and take 5 or more seconds to load. This adds to the overall clunky and unpolished feel of the entire app.|Skyward Mobile Access|1.0

2021-11-20 18:55:39-07:00|I love BrainPOP with its new movies.  It is like journeying into another world of learning with each step.  However, there seems to be a problem with accessing some movies, like “California Missions”, in the app but not the website.  It keeps saying that I need to talk to my BrainPOP Admin to unlock it, but that message doesn’t make sense.  Please fix it or help me.|BrainPOP Featured Movie|4.0

2022-01-19 00:27:39-07:00|This app is just amazing, easy to understand, and easy to use and handle. Unlike Schoology, posting assignments doesn’t take minutes and just automatically posts the assignment or image. It very easy to use, given how compacted it is and isnt just a bunch of slides that are 8 PT and cant even be read by people with eye conditions, and I’d say is just really recomended for schools since its very easy to set up, and it’s really not fustrating sisnce it never failed me once during 4th grade, and just a good way to start socializing.|Seesaw Class|5.0

And it has many tools that are useful: THE PEN, THE PENCIL, THE HIGHLIGHTER, THE ERASER, THE GLOWING PEN. It is the best app for education that I have used. It’s great for me and I am in 4th Grade.

2021-11-25 12:43:43-07:00|Hello! Those of you who think Seesaw has a perfect Instagram- like setup, and super fun and easy, you are wrong! Seesaw is annoying. The computer Seesaw is better than the app one, but they are still stupid. Teachers, kids are allow to make random videos. Just imagine the inappropriate issues your trouble-making kiddos would do! Plus, there’s no preset comments. Those trouble-making kiddos in your class could swear or hurt someone’s feelings. It also encourages kids to sneak and watch classmate’s videos instead of doing work. There’s no way to ban video making. Kids reading this, you don’t want to have Seesaw, it’s little-kiddie. The grade ranges that do enjoy it is K-1, 2nd+ just hate it. Schoolagy (did I spell it right?) is more ages 3rd grade + and is perfect! It’s harder to make videos than just tapping a button, and you can like videos. Kids have fun doing that. Teachers can also make great videos. Teachers, if you prefer Microsoft Stream, when you are showing your students how to get to it, there will be a little button in the corner to view the video on Microsoft Stream! Teachers, video making on Schoolagy (if I didn’t spell it write, I’m sorry) is amazing. Do scratchy sound issues like on Seesaw. If you are a K-1 teacher, use Seesaw (it’s the best you got) Thank you for reading|Seesaw Class|1.0

2022-03-01 14:08:37-07:00|I’ve been using UG Tabs since 2013. I love being able to find a song and instantly play along using the chords or tabs. I recommend this to all my musical friends and will continue to point people in this direction forever. UG Tabs is hands down my first and only resource for tabs and chords. Every other service WISHES they were UG Tabs. Their employees WISH they worked for UG Tabs. It’s the best. Do yourself a favor and check it out. If you don’t like something about it, tell them. They’re people. If it’s reasonable, they might look into it and get back to you. If you don’t like it, then that just means you didn’t spend long enough on it. Play until your hands hurt. Then get upset that you can’t play some more. Well, that’s what I do. I’m a Lifetime Member. I just found out RIGHT NOW that they have merchandise. Guess what’s going in my stocking this year for Christmas? Seriously, if you’ve read this far, just get the app. Good luck and have fun making music!|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|5.0
2022-03-01 07:39:15-07:00|I love this tabs app! The interface is easy to navigate, the tabs are informative, and you don’t get bombarded with ads! I have Premium, and if you’re a serious player, it’s the best investment ever! I only have 1 complaint. As of 3/1/22, the chromatic tuner is broken on iPad and iPhone. It only shows the hertz level and if it’s correct, and the little thing showing whether your high or low is missing. It still works, it’s just a little annoying to function. Otherwise, amazing, functional app!|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|4.0

2022-02-28 11:47:32-07:00|Overall, I love this app. I have just a couple complaints. I can’t play my phone’s music while the app is open. Idk if this is an apple thing or UG thing. App is sluggish and glitchy at times. And finally I wish I had more options to set up the screen to see a whole page of music at once instead of scrolling feature which is always faster or slower than I am and a pain to change the speed. Aside from these minor complaints, there’s no better app that I’ve found.Update:  latest update solved all these problems.|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|5.0
2022-02-28 07:46:08-07:00|I use this app every single day. I love it!!! Truly, it was a game changer for me. I can transpose music with a touch of a button to see if it fits the Key I need vocally. The app offers guitar, piano, ukulele chords. Plus, Ultimate Guitar has video posts from other musicians for those who prefer visually learning a song.

2022-02-23 09:16:10-07:00|Everything was great when I originally had this app in 2018 if I recall correctly. Then maybe a year or so later when I would print songs the large print song title and the chord diagrams were not on the printed page anymore and either were the chord diagrams. I put up with it because my music teacher would send me a copy of his print which works fine for him. So then I thought well maybe I’m not paying for the app or don’t have a upgraded app or something. So I have reached out to UG time after time to help find the problem. You cannot actually talk to anyone only email to resolve any issues. They only say they are working on issue and they never get back with me. I have tried closing account and starting over. I have used even a different email to start fresh. NOTHING WORKS!! When I put my birthday in my bio it can’t even get that right. I’m at my wit’s end…I don’t know what else to do…so I thought I would write this review to see if I could get someone’s attention, anyone’s attention and help. It is such a shame and very frustrating to say the least!!! There are so many great reviews and I was one of those..not anymore. I can’t get anyone to tell me if I am doing something wrong or advise me with what to do…only that they are working on the problem…they have been working on it for a few years now as far as I my account goes. IS ANYBODY OUT THERE???|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|1.0
2022-02-23 01:24:22-07:00|The only thing holding me back now is my own lack of motivation|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|5.0
2022-02-22 23:20:38-07:00|Who knows what it’s done with it there? And it is a tab app, why do I need it to make friends? This isn’t Tinder or YouTube! Do one thing and do it really well (tabs, not video dating!)|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|1.0
2022-02-22 20:00:04-07:00|I’ve been using this app for almost 10 months but I honestly love it. I love that I’ve been able to find almost every single song out there in any genre and the chords with it! Everything is made super efficiently and it’s a fantastic community. I’ve never had issues on this app with any lagging with the videos you post and so far everything is quite great. The only troubles I have are when I am tried to publish a tab for a song like if existing tabs are not accurate or I just wanted to make something different from existing tabs. I always double and triple check to make sure my tabs are different but not inaccurate but they seem to always get rejected. It’s not entirety a big issue but I would like to get it out there. Other than that I love this app and definitely recommend to anyone who loves to post videos of them playing any music genre and learning any new song while you’re at it!|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|5.0
2022-02-22 13:49:17-07:00|I am a beginner at guitar, and I didn’t really want to go searching for hours in the internet for the right chords that are easy enough for me. And I’m sure most beginners would agree. The app is safe, fun, and useful. I spend most of my time on this app. Thank you |Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|5.0
2022-02-22 11:18:45-07:00|I use this app all the time whenever I wanna find the chords for a song that I want to learn.|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|5.0

2022-02-22 04:16:41-07:00|The website and the mobile versions are very different on what the pro features are.

2022-02-20 23:55:29-07:00|I can say, without any hesitation, that .... [edit] Excellent app and wonderful creators. Responsive, and real, a vast library updated often, and resources availability to allow the individual to research many different versions of each piece of music transcribed within.... Wonderful on all counts! [....]. long before our phones started getting smart and cheeky, I had already been a long-in-the-tooth, fully seasoned regular visitor and purveyor of UG’s full desktop version, interwebbed, online website and all its wonders, contents, and wares within. I had become a vocal advocate of the site.... Very vocal, and I went above and beyond recommendations in making sure that everyone knew how good the site was. I told friends, implored to family (I have two older brothers and a gaggle of step-half- and in-laws, extended and removed) but mainly my two older brothers, regaled random strangers on the street, lectured unfamiliar professors down at the university, no I did not attend those hallowed halls, I begged parents to tell their kids, (idk I was just guessing, maybe they weren’t parents) and yes, even the small “not-so-friendly” fuzzy animals that were oh so common throughout my home town) were all made quite aware that here was an online resource so complete, so vast, that it was all they would need to ‘learn and love’ the guitar. UG, I am fan, a regular, and honestly forgot what I was even doing here... but also, for no tangible reason besides the fun and comedy fit only for the writer (moi), I strove to make sure as many people knew as possible, to spread the word of the amazing library UG had collected music songs and tab y’all had archived. And all that ‘oh yeah good stuff’ mojo that I was spreading? ... all that is ‘retro’ now, because that was many years before apps were even things, and since the launch of the app? IG just kept reaching higher and higher.... and then, 2 years ago introducing the feature allowing musicians to upload Shots to share with other players.... well that was it. Really, magical. Well in the before times, I know it’s weird, I know, but now.... all of that good juju that I was just early previously rambling on about? Well, suffice it so say that the “awesomeness of and that is UG” tho “awesome” indeed, has been rocket propelled to splendor and acclaim once heretofore unknown possibly even unexpected heights vistas and maybe plateaus of Ron Burgandy brilliance.... A leap forward in terms of service utility and enjoyability that can only be categorized with measurements using the logarithmic scales so as to track and chart the exponential explosion of what UG is.... I admit, I lost my thread long ago, but I’m staying strong on pushing through the veil of mystery to say: I had finally downloaded and installed the UG app, thus, finally wobbling my size 9’s into the 21st Century.... More than that, I wanted people to know about the community that has grown within Ultimate Guitar. A culture has evolved, one that UG cultivated throughout the years by supporting the arts and spreading community values. Now, not only are we just the students learning, but we are now, as a group, we are greater together than we are as individuals.... We are more than the sum of our parts, and I should sum this up..... We are a community, sharing a healthy culture of neighborly values. We are performers and tutors with ever shot posted... we are critics, counselors, sponsors, and mentors with every like, we celebrate others. With each comment we make, we encourage, support, and unknowingly at times, we lift others up when they need... we help to correct and reflect on our own selves along the way, as we celebrate each other. We are neighbors, performers, friends, counselors, critics, fans, and each of us, one and all, are part of a community. Each a member of a family full of amazing human beings, singing with voices that come from all corners of the world, the way it should be; easy, with no srtress, no boarders, no limits to what we can play together .|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|5.0
2022-02-20 15:59:57-07:00|got the app because the mobile version of the site is basically unusable and i gotta say the app is pretty disappointing as well. Half the time looking for a tab is spent sitting through crummy ads and the app itself constantly pushes you to join their pro plan. the community is cool and it’s great how many tabs there are but the money grubbing and obtrusive ads really take away from that|Ultimate Guitar: Chords & Tabs|2.0

2022-02-27 15:40:01-07:00|This is a great app but you need to pay for makeup and when you want to put on accessories you see it every time and it’s annoying so I payed it and it’s kinda disappointing no foundation no eyebrow pencils and there’s more then just that there’s not many color choices for hair and makeup if you curl the hair it only gets wavy and it needs more people to use I will still use it but not to often.|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0

2022-02-24 04:01:44-07:00|I purchased the makeup pack and thought there was a few things u could add 1 a beauty blender and foundation where you can pick color 2. Stencils for lips eye shadows eyebrows ect in different patterns it’s hard to stay in the lines and never looks good 3. A normal blender brush thingy for blending eyeshadow Second part More hair styling options Better layering ability Hair spray so it stays up and stiff ig Stuff like that Part 3 A back button So when u mess up makeup you can simply press a back buttonPart 4 Maybe a teasing brush|Toca Hair Salon 4|3.0

2022-02-21 16:25:30-07:00|Great app but I’m.. I love the hairstyle I can use but like when I try to do an Afro it just messes up when I get out of it not any other hairstyle just the Afro, I hope you can fix that|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-02-21 16:07:51-07:00|I don’t even know why I have the two stars because it I haven’t even played the game yet I don’t understand why I press to stars but if you ever know that I said it thank you so much I’m is in the game if I like it then I will tell you differently|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-02-21 07:37:30-07:00|First of all the game is amazing, but there are a few thing that are annoying. The first Hong is that once I completed all the avatars or people I have to do it all again I just want to work on other people. Second it is very hard to use the tools especially when you want to use them. But although it is a fun and good game|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-02-20 16:58:55-07:00|This game is very fun but I’m having a bit of trouble and was wondering if you guys would consider adding a hair spray or hair gel that locks specific parts of the hair in place so it can’t be moved with the comb and such and then it’ll like wash out|Toca Hair Salon 4|5.0
2022-02-20 12:21:59-07:00|It is so fun but you do have to pay for a lot of thing that I wish were free.|Toca Hair Salon 4|3.0
2022-02-19 16:26:49-07:00|So I recently Judy’s downloaded this game and don’t get me wrong it’s good, it’s just the hairstyles are pretty hard to do. For example, you don’t have access to rubber bands so you can’t do cute hairstyles like a ponytail, a bun, pigtails and much more. When it comes to styling the client’s hair it’s hard to have a lot of options and I usually end up putting the hair to the side most of the time. I also think that the client’s should look like they ACTUALLY need a makeover because when I pick a client I want to give them a makeover but they already look good if you know what I mean. Overall, I think this game has a good concept and is pretty fun to play.|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-02-19 16:21:44-07:00|Ok so I got the  summer thing and I restored the purchase and I still didt show up I’m MAD|Toca Hair Salon 4|3.0

Make a zoom out and zoom in feature #3 maybe hmmmmmm  aha  make  emotions! Decided on if you give the people a good haircut or a bad haircut |Toca Hair Salon 4|5.0
2022-02-17 04:06:48-07:00|I’ve pretty much realized how this game is amazingly good, and have memories of playing it with friends.   I personally like to sometimes make someone look good, other times me and a friend compete to make the worst!I still play it sometimes, and have realized it’s too fun to not have. Just a few things could be better1.) It’s mildly infuriating when you cutting hair and dodging other tools so you don’t ruin the whole cut2.) Could we make our own character to customize3.) could we get coins for doing something? A currency system just sounds like it’d be fun!|Toca Hair Salon 4|5.0
2022-02-14 06:37:59-07:00|This game is just so amazing. It is perfect for children and even for adults! It is wonderful even without the makeup or any additional things. I have had it for 2 or 3 months, but even in this small time I have fallen in love with it. It is absolutely free and there is no limit for possibility’s. I highly recommend it. There are no adds, and child friendly. I just think the designing is beautiful, and there is so much diversity in the models. Thank you Toca Boca!|Toca Hair Salon 4|5.0
2022-02-13 06:14:29-07:00|I love playing the game but there are a few problems. 1) I understand the when the costumer is taking the shower all there makeup comes off. But, I don’t have the makeup thing to redo it. The look is just unfinished then. 2) Whenever I am doing there hair, it is hard to style. This is because of their head always moving. I am fine with the sounds they make but please could they not move their heads. Every time I want to cut their hair for example, they always move it and I need to start over.|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-02-11 06:14:35-07:00|Why is the makeup not free pls make it free it’s getting frustrating what do you think ppl are? Made Of Money make it free as a matter of fact make all the makeup free|Toca Hair Salon 4|2.0
2022-02-07 18:28:17-07:00|When I play usually it’s smooth but when I use specific characters it will hack and shove off the hair and make the rest wilt|Toca Hair Salon 4|3.0
2022-02-07 13:35:03-07:00|Game is very fun and entertaining but IT is soooo frustrating|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-02-06 13:52:56-07:00|Even as an adult, I am having fun with this game, and I can totally see kids having a blast with all the crazy things you can do with the hair! Some criticisms are that I wish the game were easier to style the hair— the shelf is in the way and I keep pressing the tools, even with a stylus. Also I would absolutely love to be able to make hair buns, ponytails, pigtails, and so on. At least with the free version it’s very difficult to create actual styles. Also the makeup should be accessible to free players, or at least cheaper in the shop. I get that the game is for kids and the goal seems to be the wackier the better, but at least allow for actual styles and updos to be created? Other than that, it’s a good time waster being stuck at home!|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-02-06 09:36:12-07:00|I personally love this game it’s so fun and cool! Just in my opinion. But I think it should be free. I’m 9 years old and all I want to do Is makeup but I can’t because it’s money. If I had money I would totally get the makeup but I don’t. Please make it free :) |Toca Hair Salon 4|5.0
2022-02-05 18:30:54-07:00|You guys did great good game I have some things that I will like u to take to mind please add some Asian avatars and more races. Please add eye brow shapes and foundation and more hairTextures and a way to put it in a bun to make it more fun. But I have something to tell you the game has been glitching and I will like u to look into it. Over all I love this game.|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-02-05 16:34:36-07:00|i like it alot but and idea to add would be pony tails :) overall love this game|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0

2022-01-30 18:52:00-07:00|this game is pretty fun, my only complaint is that you can turn off the sound effects. i don’t like this because i like to watch shows while playing but sometimes the sound effects are too loud. it would be nice to have the option of turning them off and on. I also wish that the screen was a little less crowded because sometimes it makes the tools harder to use. otherwise, it’s a great game.|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-01-30 11:38:26-07:00|Idk if its just my phone but for some reason the in app purchases never work. When j piut in my birthyear it says something went wrong, and its done that every single time. Overall the game is good|Toca Hair Salon 4|3.0

2022-01-29 13:03:04-07:00|So I feel like it is really hard to like brush in the the place you want it also there should have this hair types like spiral spring curls and I think that you can put highlights in the shampoo center.But other then that I love this game and I think it is very good:)|Toca Hair Salon 4|4.0
2022-01-29 09:41:13-07:00|This is an awesome app but the tools are kind of hard to Use sometimes like if you want to make the bun that’s pretty hard through your hair but after all this game is awesome and it’s creativity and I’ve always wanted to be like a hairstylist so there’s like really helps me get inspired and I just love it but in your shop please add more stuff because I already bought everything|Toca Hair Salon 4|5.0

2021-10-28 14:31:20-07:00|Great app, but recent update created several problems. Often when finishing an activity, especially the crossword, the done button will not record the finished product. In fact, it won’t even close out the activity. Also, it appears that other students can now hack accounts and steal points. This is happened to every single person in my sons class. He’s not able to submit his work, and whatever work he does just get stolen. And no, this is not my son complaining. I have watched him do his work and seeing the bugs firsthand.|Kids A-Z|3.0
2021-10-26 07:21:23-07:00|As a teacher I loved letting my kids choose their favorite activity in Spelling City after they had finished the assigned activity. Now I can’t see any way for them to be able to have access to all of the learning games offered without assigning every activity. Also, the app has quit working on our iPads and we have to push many buttons to get it to open in the web browser since our school has us log in through clever. All in all, it has great potential, but I’m not loving it so far.|Kids A-Z|2.0

2021-07-13 21:14:40-07:00|The layout of your buttons in the read & record session absolutely need reorganized.  The fact you have the pause/start button a millimeter away from the stop button is a MASSIVE design flaw.  These are kids, pausing their recordings to practice, only to accidentally press the stop button by mistake.  It leads to them getting extremely frustrated and wanting to quit because they lose the ability to continue recording and have to start over.  Seriously, move the buttons around.  Make the stop button harder to press by accident.  Help motivate the kids instead of creating a negative experience due to poorly thought out designs.|Kids A-Z|3.0

The amount of time you take for an assignment shouldn’t be determined by a video length but by your actual understanding of the material. If you know the material like breathing it can take you 5 minutes, if you don’t understand at all it can take 50, but with this everyone takes the same amount of time, and no one gains any understanding whereas the one who doesn’t understand can see that they dont and ask for help, and the one who understands too well can be moved up a class.

2022-02-28 09:51:36-07:00|I haven’t play this game since it’s initial launch 5 years ago so I decided to pick it back up and man is it messed up. There’s ads and loot boxes all over the place, the events are impossible to complete without spending money, and ads don’t even work more than half the time. It’s bad enough that they’re over 30 seconds in length. Why can’t they provide me with an award when I watch them?!|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|2.0
2022-02-28 06:59:51-07:00|I love the base game, but I can’t count how many times I’ve watched an ad and been cheated out of a reward. It’s already an obscene amount of ads, and then on top of it they don’t even give the reward. Cheap.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|3.0
2022-02-20 05:45:59-07:00|I love the game and find myself playing all the time. Editing my previous complaint, I want to thank you for listening and fixing my daily gift problem with the last update, that makes me feel like I am not just another number. I just wish the fall fairy was not so unattainable for newer players. Other than that why are you still reading, get it now!!|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0
2022-02-19 16:42:48-07:00|Love the game!!! Super relaxing and very cute fish. The only problem is that it’s super hard to win in events anything and I used to love doing the daily goals for gems (the purple things), but now they added that I have to watch 5 ads, and I don’t want to be forced to watch ads to win! Guess I can’t win gems anymore…|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|4.0
2022-02-12 18:48:02-07:00|This game used to be one of my favorites. Cute, wholesome, and relaxing. A while back though, the event systems got re-worked. They used to be slower, with goals that could easily be accomplished with a little bit of time every day and the events spanning a longer amount of time. I don’t recall ever getting an event requirement to watch a certain number of ads to proceed to the next step. Until, they updated. How each event stage feels complicated or will take multiple days, and I’ve started getting event quests involving the amount of ads. Plus, the events are MUCH shorter. I used to be able to unlock most of the fish during the event but now, I can barely unlock some of them.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|2.0
2022-02-07 14:59:18-07:00|Some time’s when I played the game would restart and I would have to do the beginning of the game again but it did stop after a year of not playing the game but I still have my |Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|3.0

2022-01-13 09:43:48-07:00|Even when i love this game it still has some major flaws, like for one the events are more (in best terms i can say) pay to gain, as in if you don’t spend money some things are almost impossible if not impossible to get. Thats not to say the game is entirely like that its just something i find annoying in events. And lets not forget how grindy it is to get the event items, if you want to get some of the bigger fish you’ll have to grind for a few days to even get one and at the slow rate of getting such items its kind of discouraging. That said i do try and 100% games a lot.Now for the good, the game looks stunning for a mobile game, the music is calming and the fish are creative looking, there is a lot to do and get, the dumbo octopus is one of the cutest things ever and the events tho grindy there fun.Please do try this game for your self and not take it from a high schooler, i don’t think im the best at rating games.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|3.0
2022-01-11 06:09:44-07:00|The game is fun and relief stress. The has good graphics, cool updates, and more. It’s a really good game for those who are stressed out.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0

2022-01-09 06:10:10-07:00|The requirements have gotten impossible. There are never enough farm materials or time to collect without spending a lot of money? I used to love this game but now it’s nearly impossible to compete the events. So sad.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|1.0
2022-01-08 14:17:32-07:00|There have been multiple times where i’ll watch an advertisement once or even twice to get something and it doesn’t work. This is a scummy tactic.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|1.0
2022-01-06 15:11:41-07:00|I love this game! However I think you should be able to add friends and you could visit there aquariums and trade fish. I think a player to player is the only thing I am missing when I play. At least being able to add friends and send gifts. Just something. I think it would make the game way better than it already is.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0
2022-01-06 13:16:27-07:00|now all they want is money. all the events and awards require money. horrible|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|1.0
2022-01-05 13:31:36-07:00|This used to be my favorite game, but recently things have really gone downhill. The game hardly runs anymore, it is EXTEMELY laggy no matter what I do. The ads take too long to load, freeze, or just flat out don’t work half the time. The events are also getting far too complicated. Unnecessary things keep being added like the abyss pass and wish tree in this current event. You also can no longer complete the monthly bingo unless you buy something every time. Ridiculous. Please change some things back to how they were so I can play and enjoy this game again.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|2.0
2022-01-05 07:18:00-07:00|The game has lost all its heart and soul. Now it’s all pay to win. You have to spend money on almost everything. You can’t play without them begging you for money. Oh you wanna grow this tree? Oh well that gonna be $40 worth of wish lantern extensions. It’s quite sad honestly. I used to really enjoy this game but now you have to pay for things that used to be free. I miss when this used to be a cute relaxing game, and not basically a giant advertisement.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|2.0
2022-01-02 20:44:35-07:00|This game is very relaxing. I love how you can get cool stuff without paying. Yes of course it has adds and subscriptions but you dont need them to enjoy the game. You can collect vitality quickly by tapping so you can get the fish faster. The adds are optional, it’s not like you need them to get everything. Super relaxing Definitely recommend.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0
2022-01-02 14:18:39-07:00|I played this when it was new before it was sold over.I start up again and I am blasted in the face with mirco transactions of $20 $50s etc.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|1.0
2021-12-31 01:51:46-07:00|It’s very fun and relaxing! It may seem boring to some people but for me, it’s a very fun game with cool add one and lil fishys! I love games like these that can relax your mind. Although it’s very well made, I will not give a game five stars unless it is perfect. No flaws, no glitches. Otherwise, it’s a very good game and I recommend it to every body!|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|4.0
2021-12-30 13:57:47-07:00|It takes us a lot of time, but the fish are adorable. There’s many kinds. Even if you just got the app, there’s almost always an event going on, so you can still jump into that and get some awesome fish! I used to have this game a while ago but just got tired of it, but I downloaded it again recently and was happy to find that, in addition to new fish, I could still get my favorite fish in the Winter Wonderland event, or whatever it’s called.There aren’t many ads at all! Maybe when playing for a half hour you’ll get two or three, but otherwise there are few pop ups. Of course, for things like “Watch this ad to get a prize” or “spin the wheel” or something, you have to watch one, but it’s always optional. The few ads you do see are only like, 5-15 seconds long. Nothing like, 2 minutes like some other apps. The whole game is really beautiful, too. The art style is great and the fish look a lot like they do in real life, only cuter. Also, if you aren’t on for a week or two, nothing changes! You’ll come back to more money, and perhaps an event has ended, but it’s not like all your fish will be gone or your coral will be dead (note: nothing dies in this game). I’d totally recommend to anyone who likes this type of game. If you don’t like fish, this may not be for you, but there’s an app called Abyssrium Pole that’s the same thing but takes place on an iceberg, so the main focus is penguins and polar bears (I know they don’t live near one another in real life). There’s still fish, but not as many. Both games are slow, though, and require a lot of grinding. If that’s not your kind of game, you’ll probably just get really bored.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0
2021-12-26 05:23:18-07:00|I’ve played this game once a long time ago before. Of course I’ve had to restart so… that means start fresh. Before, it was hard to get a lot of fish. They didn’t have good rewards for the lucky spins. (Can’t remember if they’ve even had it). I now have 2 of the bigger fish on the spectrum, and a couple fish you would really need to buy with IRC. But I just won them from logging in! Good upgrade. Let’s see if we can make the rest of it a bit easier!|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|4.0

2021-12-11 21:31:11-07:00|I really love this game. I redownloaded it to play again but I wanted to restart the game. When I got on, it gave me no choice but to go back to my old saved data. I do not want to do that, but it is impossible to restart the game.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|3.0
2021-12-06 06:20:26-07:00|I love this game and have been playing for years. I just got back into it but i cant watch any of the ads. Which help get a lot of extra stuff lol|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0
2021-12-05 06:20:15-07:00|I used to play this game when it came out, and I just found it again. It’s an amazing game and it has a spot in my childhood.|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|5.0
2021-12-02 19:43:05-07:00|I used to enjoy this game and the events when it first came out. Was even touted as internet’s newest gem! The events were tough but fair and winable without having to pay real money. Even their Facebook page was great. Full of fans helping and chatting with each other. Now all of that is gone. Nobody posts on the Facebook page anymore. Those that do, are hidden, which is only one or two anyway. Sadly,I quit playing when they sold the game to new developers four years ago , and those developers decided to remove Song of the Moon which made earnings easier to get fish. I’d be surprised if any of the friends on my list currently are still playing as I’ve had them from the beginning when, I realized you needed them. Then developers started throwing too many things for us to earn n fuse together. Pearls etc. Which, was obvious why, they wanted money. I know I’d written a review previous to this, but it was similar and must’ve gotten removed. As it didn’t pop up, when I tried to see what I wrote. I’m surprised to see it getting still high ratings even though, when I wrote my previous review, it had gotten low star ratings from other players. Only getting one point per tap, is ridiculous. Nobody has that kind of time nor patience! I tried it, it got boring after awhile, especially when you’d maybe get somewhere tapping all DAY ?? Un uh! NOT gonna happen! Oh well, the game was there when I needed it. Even had recommended it a few times back then. Even liked the music, which is rare for me. It was soothing to play then. But, sadly, not anymore! Forgot to mention that the NEW notifications NEVER go away no matter how much you click on them! Very annoying! Guess they did away with needing friends, as I can’t find that section anymore! Also it looks like I’ve purchased most of the background stuff with event earnings and gems. Some, I could’ve sworn, I’d purchased, which now, look like I need to purchase again, but with real money! But the new designs for backgrounds, don’t look much different than what I’d gotten before I quit playing.  The fish don’t look much different either. Another sad ending to a once great game!!|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|1.0
2021-11-28 10:44:32-07:00|Fun game, but the ads take a very long time to load and often freeze up at the very end, forcing me to quit the app only to lose whatever rewards I was watching said ads to get. It’s gotten to the point where the game is borderline unplayable for me because it’s designed so that you pretty much have to watch ads to make progress|Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|3.0

I'm unable to do so and I'm struggling to see the entire top of the screen on the iPhone 12. It's almost like they expanded the screen to fit but didn't put in the effort to actually make it work, it's very clearly a square screen just with the dimensions expanded to make it seem as though it fits but nothing changed to work with the newer iPhones.

2021-10-16 10:30:59-07:00|I really like this game. It is relaxing, calm, and the special events keep the game feeling fresh. It has hundreds of fish (my favorite is the axolotl :) ) to keep you entertained. There are some small things keeping me from five stars though. One thing is that some fish seem to clip through walls, but it’s mostly an annoyance. My second thing is that I wish it was easier to get pearls without spending money. The final thing is that I wish instead of using pearls to speed up farms, that you could upgrade the to be faster/more efficient. Overall a really great game! |Tap Tap Fish - AbyssRium|4.0

2018-01-03 13:17:49-07:00|I am a visually impaired student in advanced classes. My class just started to learn and use graphing calculators but i use my iPad Pro because it helps me see better (by the way the app has big buttons and easy to see for me) so I tried to find graphing calculator apps and stumbled upon this one. I do all my worksheets my classmates get but on my iPad Pro. Since I do all my worksheets on my iPad, split screen with this app will be a big help and improvement to this app. I left out a star because there is no split screen ability. Overall, I just used it today and i played around with it and compared to other graphing calculator apps and this is the best so far. Good job on this app and thank you for your time and patience.                         If anyone is curious of the apps I use, I use google apps such as google docs, google classroom, google slides, google chrome, etc. Google is what every class in my school uses to turn in and do any electronic assignments such as essays to the teacher. I don't like Microsoft apps and neither does my school so my school doesnt use it anymore. I also heard that most schools use google and google chrome books  (cheap and small laptops that are made just to use google apps, not good for vision impairments at all but there are not a lot of kids like me) that are better then Microsoft technology in my opinion. I am also a big fan of Apple which is why I use an iPad Pro. To scan worksheets and documents, I use the new scan feature on the Notes app (iOS 11). To save, write and type on the scans I use a great app called Notability. Then I either turn in my assignments though g-mail or google classroom. Like I said another efficient way (not as efficient as Notability though because you cant write and is harder to use) is to use the google apps on apple devices (same as Chromebook google apps). I use an Apple Pen to write. I also use join.me to connect to my teachers’ Smartboard. It also is good for connecting to presentations at work. I strongly recommend this strategy for any visually impaired student or person.|EduCalc Classic|4.0

You don’t even care how long it take all IXL cares about is money so kids just stare at IXL for along time so they make more and more money.Your should make a settings for teachers, or parents to toggle if the kid has dyslexia dysgraphia or any other learning disabilities. Also you could make a toggle where there is a level for each kid if they are good then make it a little changing or if the kid is a little slow with learning make it a little easy so they can master it and make sure the understand it and make them feel like they are rushed to make them go down more because it makes no sense to give more homework or work if they don’t understand it you can just add a little video to make sure the kid get it step by step and you should be creative it’s not fun when you don’t get it and it’s so hard.You System is not good also because sometimes when you click on the right answer and it counts it wrong when you got it right.

I’m unhappy because I wasn’t informed the cost of packs of fifty puzzles go up.I can not use access pass because I have many commitments.  I only play two puzzlesithasbeen on most days.The new current prices of featured packs are ridiculous and unreasonable.  I suggest selected packs go on sale at $1.99 for fifty puzzles per year.

It adds screen space for scrolling when they are already numbered and in order. Give us the option to remove the features and move back to the old layout.

Ive learned to build words backwards and forwards. And oddly often wild guesses for names of people I’d never think I knew, I seem to find that word in the depths of my mind, which pleases me to no end.

2019-05-28 11:42:10-07:00|My son loves this app. This can keep him entertained for at least an hour. It’s great for long car trips, quiet time, or restaurants. I downloaded this for him a couple years ago and it has become one of his 2 preferred tablet apps. He plays it all the time. His cousins love this game too. They frequently will pick up the tablet and start playing it if he has left it unattended. The trial version has several mock phone apps (such as texting, weather, music, puzzles, fruit ninja, etc) and the full version has a lot more. The trial version was such a good example of the game that I thought about buying it. I never buy apps. EVER. After months of thinking about it, I finally decided to pay the $8 to unlock the full app. I thought it was pretty pricey, but my kid loves it and really wanted to be able to play the other games, so I decided why not. I went into the App Store to download it for my phone and saw that they have the full version on sale for $4 from the App Store, so I spent twice as much money to unlock it through my app. I know it’s my fault for not checking first, but I didn’t think that would be the case. So beware of that. If you decide you want the full version, buy it through the store and not through the game pop-ups. TLDR; I most certainly think this is an app worth paying for compared to a lot of the other children’s apps out there. Kids love it! I think the fact that it is $8 in app is over priced, and though the full version in the App Store is more reasonably priced at $4, it’s dumb that the two places where you can buy it are completely different prices.|Phone for Play - Creative Fun|4.0

2018-10-21 05:45:55-07:00|I have had this one for years and the kids always love it. There is a huge variety of games within, so it’s totally worth a couple bucks for the purchase in order to get rid of the ads!!! Once I put my phone on child lock it’s perfectly child friendly, and they can still change games within the app. I recently had to update my phone, so ads were back, and I was still willing to pay again to turn them back off, but when I checked into the parent screen there was a link to restore purchases, so it’s perfect again!The only downside is, one of the recent updates now causes the app to scroll all  back the beginning slide each time you exit a game. If they fix this, it will be perfect again!|Phone for Play - Creative Fun|5.0

2022-02-10 19:52:49-07:00|I found myself suddenly substituting in a Wednesday night class with 12 kids from 4-12 years old and varying levels of academic ability. With no lesson planned, I launched the app and just held my phone where everyone could see. They all loved the story-telling aspect, the interaction on each page, and the pop quizzes throughout. We only made it through the first two lessons due to time constraints but they all enjoyed it and asked if we could continue it next week. I liked the activity at the end of each lesson & how easy it was for me to reset it for the next child to try. I recommended it to all the parents that night & we’re borrowing an iPad for next week so they can see/interact better than with my small phone screen. The lessons were true to the Bible, kept the kids engaged, and had them all interacting and participating in the lessons. I highly recommend this app.|Bible App for Kids|5.0

Whether its used instantaneous or on the home screen (switched to cloud storage ) for months, it will be good for learning even for a 1996 born or any year user(s).                                      – “Donnie Jaleluia” DtG|Bible App for Kids|5.0

However, we opened it one morning and it was in German! We did not do anything to change this and I looked up the German word for language to see if I could find that word to change it and I can’t find it. If there is a way to change it back, I can’t figure it out….and even if I could, I can’t read GERMAN! The stories Are narrated in English, but all the print is in German.

2021-11-11 05:05:30-07:00|I had high hopes for this app. I was looking for an app to assist in teaching the habit of morning Bible reading. Instead, kids can skip the reading and just play. It’s far too gamified.  Also, kids can advance as fast as they want, so there is no way to teach the necessity of daily ready. Nothing prompts them to stop and digest. I will likely be deleting this because my son spends 3 minutes reading, then a half an hour gathering rewards and playing with the animated scenes. The app a makes God’s Word a game theme, not the main feature.|Bible App for Kids|2.0

2022-03-02 14:30:49-07:00|Animal Jam is a good game besides scammers and rude people. But that’s not what I’m writing about, I joined AJPW(Animal Jam) Right after beta testing. (Around 2016 I think) And after the data breach in November of 2020, my account was affected. At the time I was able to change my password, however I have now forgotten it. Now I know what you’re thinking, “Oh! You can just send a password change request through email!” Well I can’t. The email my account is under is an email I no longer have access to, so I can’t change my password or change my email without having access to it. I’m worried that if I ever get logged out for whatever reason, all my progress and items will be gone for good because I won’t be able to get into my account. I want help with that, but I’d also like to give a suggestion. Animal jam needs a newer and more convenient way to change your email, it shouldn’t be so complicated or needing access to “parent tools” That’s all too complicated!! Please help.

2022-03-02 13:44:35-07:00|Okay, I love this game! It’s very fun, and a lot to explore and do. This game was interesting to me as a kid, but it got worse. Before you go and download this, please read the review. Animal Jam had lots of ups and downs over time. Lately, it’s had good updates to the game. But the game has stuff that some kids don’t want! #1: Scammers. Lots of people can do this. Some people can offer you one rare for another. Sometimes when about to accept, they REMOVE their item(s) and get all your rares. #2: Bullies. There used to be a lot in 2019 and 2018. And there still are some bullies out there. Just watch out for those. I had dealt with some REALLY harsh bullies. #3: Strange Unexpected Appearances/ Events. Some things scarily appear with no warning. When you load onto your buddy list, everything turns into some foreign language. It dosent have English letters, it’s just weird shapes scattered around. Then there it is in English. Some things are kind of creepy or scary. To know what they are, look them up or search for scary things in the game. #4: One of the worst, Data Breach. Some people on Animal Jam have managed to find a person’s information. One of them is named Astro798. I don’t remember exactly what their name was. The hackers normally come out in October. So be aware.|Animal Jam|4.0

2022-03-01 17:31:44-07:00|I grew up with this game, I still play it but I hate how you can get away with anything and everything on the game. You can scam jammers ( steal others items ) and just get banned. You might think they won’t play again because they are banned right? Wrong, they can just make another account and do the same thing. It’s fun, but it just needs better updates and improvements.  I still love it though|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-03-01 16:41:10-07:00|I looked at this game and I thought it would be fun  but no! As soon I as I loaded in I noticed it looked way different from the pictures. I made an account and after that I immediately started to be bullied. I did report the person but it didn’t do anything! I soon became a pro but I got hacked! And I told ajhq and you did nothing about it. I have another’s account and when I tried to log in the password was changed! I asked you what the new one was but YOU NEVER RESPONDED. Over all I DO NOT recommend this game!|Animal Jam|1.0
2022-03-01 15:44:02-07:00|This is one of the most fun fames I’ve played in awhile, definitely recommend it. But I’ve been less wanting to do pack runs ever since you changed the prizes and the whole pack in general. Now since the alpha hideout is here, it’s not as hard to get on leader board which means packs can work together with strangers instead of there pack. And I loved the old pack run prizes so much I almost cried when you changed them. I might quit this game if they change every pack run prize.  I’m also quite upset the game creators are getting pretty sloppy with the designing / colors of animals / den / clothing.  And, ik this sounds really rude, ( I’m not trying to be ) but please stop adding some member things for non members! I buy membership, so I can have benefits. Now I only buy it for like 4 benefits. Also, making things like pet stations and sending pets on expeditions for non members, lowers the worth and makes many people sad. Also with my shops, now everyone can buy / sell, but that’s not that bad, it’s just makes membership worthless. Please fix / make these things better, and improve on your designing! - Quincythetiger|Animal Jam|4.0

2022-03-01 13:11:47-07:00|When is the new update I thought is was on March first?|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-28 20:45:03-07:00|Animal jam can be a fun game although I’ve encountered countless of rude people, I don’t know if it’s just me but I tend to find a lot of mean people and unfair people and scammers. Something else that is also quite annoying is decorating my den, sometimes I’ll try to move an object and it won’t let me move at all or it will only let me move an object a certain way I don’t want it. On the other hand the game is pretty okay. I personally am in the middle about how I feel about the game but yeah. Some people have different opinions. It’s a pretty good game but I’d prefer games like roblox and stuff like that.|Animal Jam|3.0
2022-02-28 18:16:52-07:00|I saw someone say in mail plz bud me I caught a scammer in ur mail vid oh and make it so y can say what’s my namE  and feel the power and I caught a scammer her username is shugarcookies92|Animal Jam|3.0
2022-02-28 16:23:01-07:00|This game is very very entertaining for my kid. Though the prices. Sapphires should cost gems. Anyways, this is a really great game.|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-28 08:15:28-07:00|I love this game so much. Except it could use some… tinkering. Like maybe a little less updates? Because I miss some of the old things from aj. Me and a few things agree. And I think you guys should maybe change the aj filter a bit? I’ve been suspended just for having a regular conversation with my friends. And some people can slip actual curse words. And I think we should upgrade the security system. Because if you report someone multiple times nothing happens, and the bully doesn’t face the consequences, they just continue to be mean or inappropriate. These are some things that really need to change because if a player is hurting another player, that could lead to something very serious. I almost wanted to quit aj many times because of this. I was getting tired of people randomly coming to my den and being rude, then leaving. Also, I think we should be able to individually kick jammers out. Because when I host a rp some people ruin it, so I wanna be able to let others enjoy the rp.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-28 04:48:17-07:00|( OK well mine at least.) In AJ you can trade, roleplay, go to party's,play mini-games, and other things I am not going to spoil!The trading is great each player can put up to 24 items they own,then ( or at the same time ) the other player would put up to 24 items they own ( then if both eccept, well you know how a trade works ) also you chat while in trade and only the 2 people in the trade can see, so it also works as private chat.Animal jam is also educational sometimes you learn without even realizing it!! You learl about animals and the envirement through The loading screen, SAFE videos, best guess, facts hidden aroundJamma, digging up fossils, and catching bugs, bats, and other stuff!!|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-27 23:23:50-07:00|I love this game and love that your membership is cheap :) but I wish u would add animal trading I know they will soon just have 1 animal but still so cool anyways i love this game so I rate it stars amazing graphics good dances promise I love this game ;)that is it here is my account if needed Foxanne35 ok bye|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-27 20:38:01-07:00|Please add more animals, and do you think you could bring back arctic foxes and make them for gems? Foxes are my fave animal and I love them so much, thank you for making this game super awesome!! |Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-27 18:49:37-07:00|Maybe make it to where you can favorite a account! One of my buddies accidentally deleted their main and maybe if you add it, favoriting makes it to where you can’t delete that account, so nobody else has to lose it on accident! It could be a small star on the side, when not favorited it’s grey, when favorited it turns a golden color! It would be really useful so nobody accidentally deletes a account|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-27 17:27:03-07:00|Ok, first before anything, I really enjoy this game and everything about it! I love the education, and every now and then I can pop off a cool animal fact to my mom she never knew. I love animals, science, and learning, so this is a lot of fun and help. Now, here comes my complaining. I really like how you can monitor what people say, because Animal Jam wouldn't be much of a kids game if you didn't. But now I will try and say something harmless as part of a role play, and it will restrict my chat. It gets a little annoying. That's like my only complaint. Aside of all that, ever thought of bringing the dire wolf animal back? I really liked that one. Maybe since your taking the main coon out you can put the dire wolf in! And maybe you could add a trading animals feature? Think about it. Luvs and Thank You Wild Works! Your amazing jammer, Angeldostfangirl.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-27 14:42:52-07:00|By reading the title you are thinking about it and are saying no.  Well please don’t say no because I have some reasons on why you should bring adventures back to Ajpw.   Reason number one is that Aj is kinda boring without it.  For example, all you do on Aj is trade, play with buddies, earn gems and sapphires, and decorate your den! But what if you don’t want to do that? Or all your buddies are offline? Well adventures on Aj makes it more interesting and if you are just bored on the game you have something to do! Reason number two is the items.  We new and old jammers have seen an item that is from adventures but we can no longer get it because you took it away! Now I am sorry if I am sounding rude but it is the truth.  If you bring back adventures on Aj then we jammers can get the item that we want! The last reason is it is just fun to play.  A lot of jammers miss that and that you took it away from us is really sad.  It is like taking away your toy that has been around sense you were five! Ajhq, thank you for listening and please answer me back.  I would like to know if you are bringing adventures back to Aj or not.Your faithful jammer,Wolvesrock24|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-27 13:58:31-07:00|nobody cares about this part so you might as well just skip it.i recently started playing animal jam again because i was watching some aj videos!  but then a very common problem for me happens once again…sapphires are hard to get.Yes i know (probably) youve seen this problem ALL OVER the reviews.but.. really. theyre hard to get.So, if you see this AJHQ, could you make an easier way to get sapphires? (other than leveling up and playing games) Thanks for wasting your time to read this.                                   -M1tt3ns|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-27 05:45:18-07:00|It's an OK game but not great. The games themselves are really rather weak but what makes animal jam interesting is the other players. Talking, chatting, trading, and doing PAC runs with other players is really what makes animal jam worth doing. My favorite other player is dragon girl 1264. Playing with her is what makes it all worthwhile.|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-26 20:42:45-07:00|Animal Jam is hands down, one of my favorite games of all time. While not perfect, this game is great for making friends, if you’re that extroverted type.  School is pretty lonely, but Animal Jam is so much easier to make friends in. If you’re looking for a game to simply chill out and make friends, this is the game for you!To AJHQ:AJ Jump needs to be updated. You can’t log in to transfer your Gems on it… it would mean a lot if you fixed it! :)Take your time if you need to; a little longer won’t hurt.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-26 20:35:44-07:00|I like the idea of what you can do in the game it’s just how do I put this well wen you buy a den it’s 100 sapphire’s but when you want your money back cause you want it back you give your den back but the problem is you spend sapphire they give you coins not sapphire so and you have to spend like 9$ and 99cents witch is icspessev  real money so that’s all|Animal Jam|5.0

2022-02-26 15:28:03-07:00|So this game is the hit for me right now and I love the games to play with someone, but I think you should add chess. That would be super fun! And some of the players are very mean but I don’t think that’s a problem for me.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-26 14:39:45-07:00|So this game is amazing! I really recommend it.BUT. this game crashes a lot and it’s very hard to get ur wishies and sapphires. Please make it LESS challenging then it is now to get your wishies and sapphires also please take off the password when u sign out! I have to make another account because of that! Also start new jammers with at least 250 saps and three wishies they could choose and a sap animal! So people don’t bully them. Please please PLEASE when someone reports a scammer or bully take them out the game IMMEDIATELY! There is a lot of cyber bullying and I even faced it! So please do these things! But other than that. Your game is amazing! You can chat make friends trade and more! Thanks for reading this and make sure to do these things!!!  ~Wolfieplayzz|Animal Jam|3.0

2022-02-26 12:22:32-07:00|I’ve been saving up for SO LONG for a membership. I finally have enough to buy one with sapphires! I think it’s WAY too expensive! It should honestly be only 175 sapphires for the one month membership! I mean it’s only a month! Don’t get me wrong, the game is great, but it’s VERY EXPENSIVE FOR A MEMBERSHIP! PLEASE LOWER PRICE IMMEDIATELY!|Animal Jam|4.0
2022-02-26 09:54:45-07:00|Fer.al deserved better. The Fer.al players deserved better. I hope the players who play your other games quit and stop playing because your devs are greedy dirtbags.|Animal Jam|1.0
2022-02-26 09:32:24-07:00|Ok so, lately I’ve heard a lot about this place dinoland, and I wanna know how to get there. Is this just a lie, or a real place???? some jammers have said it’s a new world coming soon, and others say to keep logging in and out and in and out until you spawn there. I’ve already tried that, I did it for like literally 15 mins so yeah. Otherwise very good game, my fave game to play. And pls look at my Fer.al review pls bye ty and WHY WHY WHY WHYYYYY DID YOU SHUT DOWN FER.AL ITS MY FAV GAME :’) I UNDERSTAND NOT ENOUGH PLAYERS BUT ITS NOT FAAIIIIIRRRR |Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-26 07:54:34-07:00|Look I love animal jam and always have but I keep getting my system hacked if you could figure out how to fix that it would be great. And it’s not just me getting hacked other players told me in a chat that they got hacked too. So there is proof someone is hacking the player’s account like I said it’s not just me, it’s also messed up to those who had a membership because those are hard to save up for. Other then this issue I think animal jam is amazing. Thanks for listening to my long request.|Animal Jam|5.0
2022-02-26 05:38:12-07:00|Animal jam play wild is a pretty good game. there are some cons though… first, there are some inappropriate players who find ways to say bad things. Next, there are MANY scammers. Last, getting sapphires is really difficult.|Animal Jam|3.0
2022-02-25 21:57:18-07:00|Now, not being rude but- I seriously HATE how you closed feral. I CRYED WHEN I SAW THAT. I want it back this night, tomorrow, or in 3 or 2 days. (If it’s possible) I might check back in a week and if it isn’t fixed I’ll not play aj for a month and if it’s not fixed still I won’t play for 3 more months. I’m not joking. Please get feral back and other people might have cried aswell. Okay?|Animal Jam|2.0
2022-02-25 15:41:11-07:00|I love this game is much so much facts too try it out but it is sooo hard to get sapphires and almost everything is for sapphires but it’s still good and such good graphics and I love it!|Animal Jam|5.0

2021-05-10 06:22:49-07:00|From what I can tell from my usage as well as from our teachers are saying, there is no easy way for parents to see what work is still out and needs to be done from the parents phone. In order to get her this information, you have to check the student’s device which is not helpful when you’re trying to stay on top of things while you’re at work. Fix this and the rating goes way up. It’s good to see the teacher student communication AND also what work has been completed|Seesaw Parent and Family|2.0

2020-10-27 12:03:41-07:00|Decent way to keep in touch with teachers, except you can’t initiate a message to the teacher. Only the teacher can initiate messages.

You’re better off downloading the seesaw CLASS app to be better involved in your child’s classroom.

What would actually be helpful is if you could have more than one child listed and then toggle between them. Secondly, they really need to add the ability for parents to be notified when new assignments have been added.

I have to login to Seesaw class as my child’s login so I can take a picture of their work on my phone. Obviously my child can take a picture of the photo via their laptop computer, but who the hell wants to position a notebook in front of their laptop or iPad cam that’s blurry to show their work?

2022-03-01 18:27:45-07:00|Pay for both the monthly subscription and the premium pass, and was in a event and now the game won’t load. All day long. Just sits on 0%. Got a pop up message saying connection  to server lost try again. But even turned off my phone and rebooted numerous times hasn’t helped or fixed the issue. It seems the only way to get a hold of someone is in the game. If I can’t get into the game how does that help me??? Since their last update, the game has been very glitchy. Floor plans not loading right, seeing double fireplaces, fridges, no doors to rooms. I enjoy this game but it leaves me little choice but to contact apple and report fraud for charging my card when the game no longer works. Card was charged yesterday. Now the game won’t work.|House Flip|1.0
2022-02-27 07:52:23-07:00|I wanted to try this game. I couldn’t even make it through the very long tutorial session because I found no settings to turn off the music and sounds. It is important to me. Also, I prefer to have so ways to explore the game instead of being forced to click exactly where it tells me so I can see how something pretty self-explanatory works. I liked the layout, the visual look of the game so far, but I deleted it for these two reasons.|House Flip|2.0

2022-02-16 13:15:53-07:00|This game is moderately fun. One of my biggest critiques is that it takes almost 10 minutes to load. You would think hat after that it would be pretty high speed, but it takes forever to do anything on the game. I also liked the game better when it was Chip and Joanna Gaines instead of the new people (Gabriel and Samantha). Not my favorite game.|House Flip|3.0
2022-02-13 17:03:34-07:00|You can redesign things but once you make ur choice, it takes like an hour to finish. I personally don’t enjoy games like this because i usually play a game for like 30 minutes and then move on. I’m not just gonna come back for a short bit of gameplay and then wait. This is just me though. The game is good. It is well made and has good graphics/functions. I just find it annoying that you can’t keep playing until you want to stop.|House Flip|4.0
2022-02-12 15:27:04-07:00|This is a awesome game but I’m disappointed because the game freezes but this time it took my away my progress my designs to the old way they before I reconstructed it’s not fair it to my designs money in grease points I was almost done with my home fix this app!|House Flip|2.0
2022-02-04 12:46:45-07:00|I loved this game at first but as time went on. I am losing aspects of game play. I purchased a contractor to achieve 4 and it reverted back to 3 within an hour. I have very odd ads and extended ad times than originally. I purchased the premium pass for $9.99 and unable to receive the benefits from the Phoenix location. My skill set progress does not register properly anymore or unlock the proper skills after achievement. The swatches I obtain are not correct either. There is a loop of specific players in voting. There is a code in my top left corner on the loading screen that says HF-NDB3FKX6L9459F44SUKDD2BX|House Flip|2.0

I will continue to play hopefully this review will get noticed and the bug will be fixed.|House Flip|4.0
2021-12-22 20:09:35-07:00|I used to enjoy playing this game. But it seems every update brings new annoyances to it. The decor has, in MANY cases gotten ugly! It used to be kinda fun to try to make a pretty house. And it could be done. Not anymore. The flooring updates in this latest version are SO ugly and completely unrealistic. And don’t get me started on the marble for countertops and floors! In fact, the only countertops I’ve seen that actually look better would be level 3 granite. After I reached Dublin I took a break from the game. I got tired of voting on other players designs. It seemed very few players tried to make their houses look nice. Ugly is not fun. I opened the game the other day to see what was new and saw they finally added fireplaces, but also three new cities! With that many new cities it’s surprising they would make so many changes to their decor. Maybe the surge in expansion is to blame for such lousy changes. My houses that I’d left completed but unsold were disgusting to look at since the “upgrade” made the design elements I’d chosen incompatible. I’m in the process of selling off all my houses with the idea I will most likely delete the game when this Profit Ladder is over. It just isn’t fun anymore. Also—the new mini-games are not fun either. The animations, as with all other animations in this game are WAY too slow. I’ve given the game two stars instead of one, because after playing it for two years or more, it’s a little hard to delete it.|House Flip|2.0
2021-12-22 18:55:52-07:00|Love the game. BUTTT it never wants to load half the time and sits on the flip house screen forever.|House Flip|3.0
2021-12-19 11:49:23-07:00|they’re too busy with ADs to CARE ABOUT THE GAME THEYRE OUT FOR PROFIT ONLY AND THEY DONT REFUND FOR THEIR GLITCHES THAT KEEP YOU FROM MOVING FORWARD!!!!|House Flip|1.0
2021-12-19 07:48:25-07:00|I usually am excited for the new updates, but this most recent one changed the floating shelves with the top tier cabinets from wood to look horrendously fake, matching the cabinet color. They looked so good with the wood before. I don’t understand this change. Also some colors on other swatches (pavement, etc.) don’t look realistic anymore either.|House Flip|2.0
2021-12-16 16:26:01-07:00|I enjoy playing the game and while I’m not a daily player, it’s very frustrating to come back and see that the new features require hearts to unlock. Now normally that wouldn’t be a problem but hearts are hard to come by without spending a ridiculous amount of money. 9.99 for 2500 hearts when the new features cost 2000 hearts to unlock is ridiculous. The prices of the unlocks need to be reduced or it needs to be easier to earn hearts without having to spend real money. Either that or make them premium features and idk don’t put them in the houses unless players unlock them. I hate working to renovate a room only to be stuck with a fireplace that doesn’t match. I also feel like the slots for the swatches should have at least a few that cost in game money instead of hearts or should at least be unlocked across each level. I unlocked a swatch earlier for one of my staging options and it’s only available for the staging level I bought the slot for. It makes it hard to enjoy the game when I don’t have the disposable income to spend on features that should be available to everyone.|House Flip|2.0
2021-12-11 05:24:41-07:00|This little app is a great way to pass the time. It fills a niche for me in that there’s no specific level you’re trying to beat that has the potential to reset if you don’t finish it all in one sitting. There’s plenty to keep you entertained for a few hours, at least once you level up and open more cities, but you can play for as little or as much time as you’d like, which makes it a great game to play when you’re waiting for something and you’re not sure how much time you’re going to have.A year plus into playing this, it can get a little repetitive, but usually just when I start to feel a little bored with it, the developers release a new city or new design feature so I have something else to work toward.I haven’t tried any other home designs apps, so I can’t compare on that front, but this app gets 5 stars from me for three reasons:1) After over a year, I am still playing it and enjoying it consistently, which for my ADHD obsession-of-the-moment brain is SAYING SOMETHING lol2) This is one of the few apps that does not feel like it exists to tempt you into spending money. There are things for sale, sure, but not owning them really doesn’t hinder your game experience. “Elbow grease” limitations mean you won’t be able to play for hours on end unless you buy some sort of upgrade, but honestly something that keeps me from playing for hours on end is a plus in my book, and you can do quite a lot with the allotment they give you and the boosters you’ll earn in-game for free.3) The support team is AWESOME. I’m used to apps where you “report” a bug and for all you know you’re just shouting into the void, so I was very impressed when I was experiencing a glitch and reached out to the support team and was immediately answered by a real human who went in and fixed the issue on my own specific account, then checked in with me a few days later to make sure we were all good. For issues that affect a wider range of players, they are pretty quick on the bug fixes too, and they seem to actually listen to player feedback when it comes to game design. Definitely refreshing to see a team that seems genuinely invested in each user’s experience.|House Flip|5.0
2021-12-02 07:53:11-07:00|One of the reasons I have played and enjoyed game is because it didn’t cost an arm and leg to play for those of us on fixed incomes. Now you basically have to buy premium pass to move on. My game is now going to cut back after years of playing|House Flip|2.0
2021-12-01 18:32:07-07:00|I just recently started playing this game and at first I thought it was a little bland and boring. The more I played, the funner it got. I splurged and purchased the Premium Pass for $9.99 (I never spend that kind of money on games) and two days later, the pass was already expired. I suppose I should have looked more carefully, but I never expected it to expire so quickly. Needless to say, I feel cheated and angry.I will probably continue to play, but I won’t be spending any more money if that’s the way it works. It seems that if you buy a monthly Premium Pass, it should last you a month no matter when you purchase it.|House Flip|5.0
2021-11-26 17:16:07-07:00|Just recently redownloaded after a year or so having a new phone. I love the game concept itself however the new updates are horrible. The colors are ugly with way less options. Is a total scam now because once you unlock Salt Lake City, it takes like a FULL DAY of not touching the game to build up enough elbow grease just to be able to get a few tasks accomplished. Making the need to use hearts more often and ultimately trying to lure you into purchasing hearts for outrageous prices. Very disappointed.|House Flip|2.0
2021-11-20 23:51:17-07:00|I too, have been playing this game for many years. I take breaks and come back to it. Just recently, an update totally ruined the colors of almost every style except Coastal. Also, the floor and counter swatches you click on aren’t really that color. I do enjoy the games, but I don’t like that I never seem to open more color swatches without hearts… which take money. Still enjoying playing, but fix the colors if possible!The last update seems to have fixed the colors. Thank you!|House Flip|4.0

2021-11-13 21:08:46-07:00|I love this game first off.  After the recent updates and changes however, I’ve NOT been enjoying it as much.  I decided to check the reviews and see if other users felt the same… I’m not alone thankfully.  Most of all, I personally don’t enjoy the color changes…NOT appealing.   I’ll most likely continue to play, because I’m hopeful that some revisions can get us back to a more aesthetically pleasing options.|House Flip|3.0
2021-11-07 16:38:04-07:00|I am so disappointed in how the new changes look cartoonishly. I used to love the “real” look but now it’s just crappy! I do like the fireplace addition.|House Flip|2.0

2021-11-05 12:07:40-07:00|The last couple updates have ruined this game completely. All the design colors have changed, nothing matches or looks pretty anymore. And now there is this weird shadow/highlight effect on everything that looks horrible. On top of that they started charging for all these things. After you’ve earned a new color/design you have to then pay for it with hearts (to that many hearts you need real money), why do we need to pay for something we worked for?I’ve been playing this game for years, and I loved it. It was wonderful. Now it looks so bad I want to cry. I’ve invested real money into this game, and now I’m so sad and upset with all the terrible changes I don’t even want to open the app. Please bring back the pretty colors, and get rid of the stupid shadowing effect, so we all can enjoy this app again.|House Flip|1.0
2021-11-01 12:40:10-07:00|Are you kidding me?!  A game that looks great, but absolutely no tutorial!  I can’t figure out for a day what to do.  Please throw us a bone.  As least the basics.|House Flip|2.0
2021-10-25 11:14:23-07:00|This is mostly a great game. I play with my children. And I understand all apps aim to make money and recently (we just started playing after a long break so I’m not sure when The switch happened) and it seems you need to spend more money for things. Like design styles you need to unlock with hearts - how do you get 3000 hearts without spending actual money?! And yes we complete all daily challenges and we win a lot of competitions. Also, after Phoenix it really takes way to long to complete projects… 7 hours! 11 hours!! Seriously?! This game is for kids!! Shorten the timeframe!!! The elbow grease also takes way too long to fill. Like I said I understand you want to make money- but again this is a kids game! And this makes it impossible to compete in the competitions without using a grease filling tool or a swift builders tool which we had saved up but I noticed they don’t seem to give for winnings anymore. They seem to be switching to tickets. Which are fine but it’s only one item at a time - Swift fixers does all contractors. But the idea behind the game is wonderful, easy fro kids to navigate, and no ads is so wonderful- I don’t have to worry when my kids play. And maybe trying to get people to pay for more and more things is how they keep adds off which is understandable. But at least cut the building times down! Kids can’t wait 7 - 11 hours to complete one game. And they shouldn’t even be on screens that long! And they shouldn’t have a game that needs to be checked in on and played several times a day.  Make it more attainable for the ages you’re aiming to use your app!|House Flip|3.0

2021-09-28 12:19:49-07:00|This game is super fun but it’s SUPER hard to get “elbow grease”. I have to wait a few hours until I can play again because I always do extra jobs. I would recommend to make a way to add things using money or hearts entirely so I can play longer. Otherwise, Id give this game five stars.|House Flip|4.0
2021-09-28 11:03:16-07:00|My only hesitation is that there is no way out of showcasing a toilet.  If I spend time beautifying my other rooms, I don’t want the bathroom to be my only choice for the interior pic!   Other than that, it’s a great game!   I do well without spending a lot of money, however, I have splurged on new decor choices that are well worth it!|House Flip|4.0
2021-08-29 10:22:43-07:00|When I spend hearts on a mystery crate I’m always hoping for swatches, not boosters. It shouldn’t be this hard to get more color variety in game. Also, the team events remind me why I hated group projects in school- one person doesn’t complete their part it hurts everyone. But I could overlook that for a better system in place for gaining new swatches.|House Flip|3.0

2021-08-07 15:17:08-07:00|Hi! Thanks so much but can you please please take care of the problem where every three minutes you get kicked out of the app! I also think you should have more options of furniture and be able to take out walls. It is a really really great game! Also could we see the people who buy the house looking around and have kind of like a open house added to it? I think that would be kind of cool. I also think you should be able to add paintings to the walls and decide where you want the couches and lighting to be. And can we also see the workers working? That would be very very cool. I also think that you should be able to decide how your house is designed and where to put the walls. I also think you should be able to customize the bedroom so that you can make them for kids or adults and put stuffed animals on the floor and things like that. I also think it would be very very cool if you could go upstairs and downstairs and maybe put in some stairs and maybe also be able to put down carpeting. And also when you design in the house I think it would be very cool if we were able to see other houses around it and maybe put up signs around it for us for an open house in and be able to tell the virtual people all about the house and stuff. Please fix this app because I love this game and I don’t want to have to stop playing it because it keeps kicking me out or because there isn’t enough things to put in the house.|House Flip|4.0

The other few times we did not get the pop up and proceeded to reading plan only to have the content fail to load.

So if you happen to have an intelligent child that learns at a higher level than their age group, it doesn’t stop or stunt their progress like other learning apps that keep them in their age groups regardless. The cons to this app is unfortunately as of late, now that their trying to “fix bugs”. My kiddo hasn’t been able to successfully get into his learning for the past 2 months and our annual plan is supposed to renew here soon so I’m not sure if to keep it or not as we haven’t been able to use it and has been starting to feel almost like a waste. :/Please fix these issues as soon as possible, my kiddo has been working so hard on his learning outside of this app but with his adhd this has been the best method we’ve found so far that he can hyper focus with and stay up with his skills and not fall back.|HOMER Learn & Grow|1.0

No game under my daughters log in worked, switched to my sons and it just kept loading as well. I got out of the app multiple times and even restarted my iPad, nothing would work.

Would make sense to advertise that first that’s why I’m only giving 2 stars.

2014-11-16 07:51:06-07:00|I've had this app on my phone for a couple years (4s, now on the 6). I have tons of kids apps for those moments when you've just got to give your kid the phone, and this one is STILL among the top 5 or so apps that they use. It's very simple to use and very responsive, and gets new coloring pages frequently. There are probably at least 150 coloring pages, and what the kids color is auto saved and always still there until they clear it.  No ads that I've seen either, not sure an app gets much better than that!|My Coloring Book Free|5.0

2022-03-02 16:51:16-07:00|Amazing. Love it.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0
2022-02-26 07:24:43-07:00|Very detailed. Used this my entire pregnancy. You can see what baby looks like at any stage, in 3D - which is super cool - but the articles that are featured are great too. Any time I have a question around a certain gestation, there’s usually an article including an answer around the same time! Great app and will use it again if I ever have another.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0
2022-02-18 12:56:09-07:00|I used this app with all 3 of my pregnancies (2014,2016,2020) it’s a must the baby pics and comparison sizes are adorable the info about where babies at and what’s growing is very cool but you MUST follow the timeline lol especially pack hospital bag|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0
2022-02-11 02:19:16-07:00|My partner and I found out I’m pregnant recently, so I downloaded this app and a few others. It was great at first, but it’s always one week ahead? I’m not sure if that’s normal or not, but I’d rather have it show what’s currently going on and then read about the future weeks. I would go to show my friends and they’d love the comparison and actual size but then I’d look and say “oh wait that’s next week *taps back a week* THIS is currently.” My due date is in there accurately, and it shows up as the right week on all my other apps except this one. Another thing is I hate the update. So much. The new set up is more confusing than the old. The diary entry part is gone so all of my notes are gone. I’m just very unhappy with this whole experience. The only saving grace of this app is the (week ahead but you can always go back to the beginning) 3D model of your baby. That’s literally the only reason I’m keeping the app. Other than that, I probably won’t be using it.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|2.0
2022-02-09 21:27:20-07:00|I tried several pregnancy tracking apps through my pregnancy and this one by far was my favorite. It helped me keep up with my appointments, weight, baby, and my bump!|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0

2022-02-06 18:13:17-07:00|I used this app for my first son. It was absolutely phenomenal. Easy to use, you were able to see your baby grow week by week, new articles to read, and so much more. Being able to try my own body was so helpful. While all these things are still available, the interface is SIGNIFICANTLY less user friendly. I would have given to app 10 stars last year. I’m giving it 4. Can I please have the old app back?|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|4.0
2022-02-01 16:05:48-07:00|I loved the app for my first child now 2. I wish there was a way to add a new pregnancy without clearing out the old data. I would like to keep my first babies info on there for comparison and honestly a little memorable thing to have on my phone pls help.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|3.0
2022-01-30 12:47:52-07:00|I’ve tried about five pregnancy apps. This one is by far the best. My husband and I love the 3D model! There’s also an option to check to see what your ultrasound would look similar to based on how far you are. This is just like the Ovia app but also has a 3D model. Symptoms are the tiniest bit easier to track on ovia, but after 8 weeks I stopped tracking which made this app my priority and perfect tracker. It can also track the symptoms, your appointments, and tasks. There’s many informational articles as well to read.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0
2022-01-13 21:41:00-07:00|The app has been very informative and helpful. Tonight while reviewing Week 15, in the section covering the Spouse it gave me information on paternity leave based upon Danish Law. I feel like this must be a copy/paste mistake as nothing else in the app is specific to any single country. Good luck!|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0
2022-01-11 06:24:33-07:00|I love the design of this app and think it’s so neat. Def will be planning to pay for it once the free weeks are up.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0

2021-10-22 15:36:37-07:00|I am 19 weeks today and the app has been showing me at 18 weeks & 6 days. I thought maybe deleting and re-installing the app would refresh this issue, but when I tried logging back into my account it was as if I had never used the app before. I lost all my notes, baby names, pics, etc. I have contacted support, hoping they can restore my account but I’m truly sad and disappointed because this was my favorite pregnancy tracking app that I had come across. I hope I hear back soon…|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|2.0

2021-10-19 11:39:01-07:00|Used to love this app but since the last update my days have been off, they are a day late to change week and there’s a gray box where the week and days used to be.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|2.0
2021-10-19 06:27:45-07:00|I love this app however it does not let you add your items to the hospital bag or birthing plan that are not pre written.

2021-10-18 12:28:20-07:00|Says I’m 24 weeks and 6 days but according to my due date and every other app and my doctor I’m 25 weeks today. The app gives readings 1 day behind even with an accurate due date. It has been doing this since the last update and this update did not improve or give an accurate reading. Baby center is better.I’m updating my review because the developer was responsive and I appreciate seeing that they’re taking the reviews and putting them into the updates! I have kept this app as the weekly pictures are astounding in comparison to other apps and I enjoy the different daily articles. Definitely worth the download.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0
2021-10-18 06:29:24-07:00|Used all throughout my pregnancy. I love this app. Predicted the correct due date and showed me models and information about how far my baby should be developed at that particular week. I have all the features .

2021-10-16 07:27:17-07:00|The app worked wonderfully until the last update. Now the dates are off and there is a grey box over the 3D baby image instead of the week count on the image. I think it looks bad. Return the app to its prior appearance.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|4.0
2021-10-14 17:25:39-07:00|Every time the app gets updated my dates get changed. It told me to update yesterday and now my days are one day behind saying I’m 10 weeks 4 days today when I’m actually I’m 10 weeks 5 days today. I still use it for the great 3D images for each week.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|3.0
2021-10-13 13:31:37-07:00|I love this app for many reasons. The articles are helpful, the 3D weekly views of the baby’s growth make the experience even more exciting.  The only thing I find is that the calculations have been off with the most recent update. The view of the baby will say 34 weeks and the calculator underneath states, “33 weeks and 4 days.” It just recently started happening.  Otherwise, I love the app.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|4.0
2021-10-12 11:49:00-07:00|The app is awesome but when I turned 33weeks it was still saying I was 32 and wouldn’t change the days of the week I was on but it said I only need 7 weeks to deliver but won’t change to 33 weeks and it stays the same as the day before|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|3.0
2021-10-09 07:24:41-07:00|Okay! I just have to say since the new update came out. This app has been a thousand times better.

This is so helpful for me.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|5.0
2021-10-08 11:49:12-07:00|the new update you guys just had me do is confusing and makes no sense, in different areas of the app it’s telling me I’m 9 weeks then the 3D image says I’m 10. I love that this app allows me to see how it looks to grow but this new update is trash and needs to be fixed.Update: the week and days of how far along I am are off and the 3D image shows me what it showed before I updated the app, but now it’s say the development is a week late|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|3.0

2021-10-06 11:25:49-07:00|Ever since the update it’s not getting my week correct it’s either a week behind or a week ahead.

2021-10-05 16:29:12-07:00|I absolutely loved this app up until the new update came out. This update is a week off and has the wrong date. This needs to be updated|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|3.0

2021-09-27 16:33:46-07:00|The app has worked great up until this point. After the most recent update it now has the wrong size of my baby. It is one week behind. I’m 27 weeks and it says I’m 26. Right below the 3D baby it says congratulations you are 27 weeks. So annoying when it worked perfectly until now. Also, the sizes of your food are way off sometimes in relation to the actual baby.|"Pregnancy + | Tracker App"|3.0
